About this report
The markets for hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related semi-synthetic cannabinoids (SSC)
are rapidly evolving areas with relatively limited information currently available. The
European situation presented in Section 1 can only provide an overview and will necessarily
be incomplete, it also serves to highlight the need for close monitoring. During 2023, a
number of developments, such as reports of important law enforcement seizures and
changes in legal status, have already taken place in some countries and, where possible,
updates have been included.
Terminology and definitions
The terminology and definitions used to refer to and describe cannabis and cannabinoids can
differ substantially based on the context of use, country, as well as over time. For example,
differences in use and definitions can be found for the terms ‘cannabis’, ‘hemp’, and
‘marijuana’, or ‘marihuana’, both within the scientific community and between different
legislative and regulatory systems (see footnote 3 for further details). Due to this complexity,
unless a definition is provided in the publication, it typically reproduces the term verbatim
from the original source in order to ensure the original meaning is conveyed.
Finally, Section 1 of the publication uses the definition of low-THC cannabis found in the
EMCDDA publication, Low-THC cannabis products in Europe (EMCDDA, 2020), namely
‘products being or containing cannabis herb, resin, extracts or oils that claim or appear to
have a very low percentage of THC and which would be unlikely to cause intoxication’.
Methods
This publication is primarily based on information from the scientific literature. Searches of
the scientific literature on the chemistry and pharmacology of hexahydrocannabinol (HHC)
and closely related substances were undertaken using chemical structure searches in
SciFinder® for ‘HHC’. In addition, text searches for ‘hexahydrocannabinol’ and ‘HHC’ were
conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, as well as other open sources, including Google.
Systematic searches were conducted between 1 November 2022 and 27 February 2023 with
occasional subsequent searches undertaken for updates and additional publications. Results
from searches were screened for relevance and selected publications were reviewed. Where
relevant, the reference list of the publications was then checked for additional relevant
references. In addition, regulatory documents, conference proceedings, and books on
cannabis were also used for relevant information or older citations not likely to be indexed in
other databases.
In addition, information on the current situation in Europe with HHC and other semi-synthetic
cannabinoids (SSC) was also provided by the European Union Early Warning System on
new psychoactive substances (EWS) and the EMCDDA’s expert networks.
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances

HHC at a glance
Common name: hexahydrocannabinol (abbreviated as HHC)
IUPAC name: 6a,7,8,9,10,10a-hexahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-ol
What is known:
 HHC was first described in the scientific literature in 1940.
 HHC is chemically similar to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the main
psychoactive substance in cannabis.
 According to laboratory studies in vitro, and in several animal species in vivo, HHC
appears to have broadly similar effects to cannabis and THC products.
 The pharmacology and toxicology of HHC in humans has not been studied.
 HHC does not appear to have documented legitimate uses.
Legal status: HHC is not scheduled under the 1961 and 1971 UN Conventions. In the
European Union (EU), HHC is monitored as a new psychoactive substance (NPS) by the
EMCDDA through the EWS. At the time of writing this report, HHC was not controlled in most
EU Member States.
Classification: for monitoring purposes, the EMCDDA may class NPS according to their
chemical structure, pharmacological mode of action, and origin (i.e. natural, semi-synthetic or
synthetic).
 Chemically, HHC is categorised as a tricyclic terpenoid derivative with a benzopyran
ring (or as an hexahydrobenzochromene). The chemical classification is not unique,
as different structural elements and classification algorithms can be used.
 Pharmacologically, HHC is classified as a cannabinoid (i.e. substance that acts on
the cannabinoid receptors).
 Based on origin, HHC is classed as a semi-synthetic cannabinoid. This is because
the HHC detected on the market is synthesised from cannabidiol (CBD), which in turn
is extracted from low-THC cannabis (hemp).
Availability in Europe:
 HHC was first identified in Europe in May 2022. Over an eight month period between
May and December 2022, it had been identified in 70 % of the EU Member States.
 HHC is sold openly as a ‘legal’ replacement for cannabis and THC products.
 HHC is sold as low-THC cannabis flower and resin that have been sprayed or mixed
with HHC, vapes, and food products (commonly known as ‘edibles’), such as sweets.
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
6
 Low-THC cannabis flower and resin containing HHC have a similar look and smell to
illicit cannabis. It is therefore possible that HHC may be deliberately or accidentally
mis-sold as, or used to adulterate, cannabis, THC, and CBD products.
 Since HHC was first identified, a further two SSCs, HHC acetate and
hexahydrocannabiphorol, have been identified on the European drug market.
Responses:
The EMCDDA has responded to potential public health and social risks from this new market
with a range of actions, including the production of this technical report that provides
authoritative information on HHC and closely related substances. These are intended to
strengthen awareness of this emerging issue and to support preparedness and response
measures at national and EU levels. In particular, they are intended to support the work of a
broad range of practitioners and other experts, including those working in analytical, clinical,
and forensic laboratories, early warning systems, public health, health care, law
enforcement, risk assessors, risk managers, as well as policymakers, and decision-makers.

Section 1. HHC and the European drug market
1.1 Purpose
In late 2021, a new semi-synthetic cannabinoid (SSC) called hexahydrocannabinol (HHC)
emerged on the drug market in the United States (US). It is synthesised from cannabidiol
(CBD), which in turn is extracted from low-THC cannabis (hemp). HHC is sold openly as a
‘legal’ replacement for cannabis and THC products, and appears to have similar effects.
Subsequently, in around May 2022, HHC was identified in Europe for the first time. By 31
March 2023, the EMCDDA had received reports through the EU Early Warning System on
new psychoactive substances (EWS) that HHC had been identified in a range of products in
20 European Union (EU) Member States and Norway.
Given the open sale of HHC, its apparent rapid proliferation, potentially large user-base, and
no history of use in humans before 2021, the EMCDDA identified the need for authoritative
technical information on this new cannabinoid and closely related substances. Together with
other responses (see below), this report aims to help bridge this gap by bringing together
what is known, and – equally importantly – highlighting what is unknown about this
cannabinoid. It is intended to support the work of a broad range of practitioners and other
experts. They include: those working in analytical, clinical, and forensic laboratories, early
warning systems, public health, health care, law enforcement, risk assessors, risk managers,
as well as policymakers, and decision-makers.
The publication is divided into two sections. Section 1 provides a brief background to the
appearance of HHC and other SSCs on the drug market and an overview of the situation in
Europe up to 31 March 2023. In the latter case, this is largely based on information reported
to the EMCDDA through the EWS. It also highlights some priority areas for research to
address important information gaps.
Section 2 provides a technical review of HHC. It includes: a brief history of recent hemp
regulation in the United States leading to the emergence of HHC and other SSCs on the
market; as well as information on the chemistry, physical properties, methods of
identification, methods of manufacture, pharmacology and toxicology, as well as legitimate
uses of HHC. It also reviews the available scientific information on some closely related
cannabinoids that have also recently emerged on the drug market or may do so in the near
future.
In addition to this publication, other responses to HHC and SSCs by the EMCDDA include:
 intensive monitoring of HHC within the EWS in order to better understand the
potential risks to Europe. This requires Member States to expedite reporting of
identifications of HHC to the EMCDDA (EMCDDA, 2019a);
 regular review of signals related to HHC and other SSC, as well as information
exchange with the EWS network, including alerting the network to other SSCs
identified on the market (EMCDDA, 2019b; Evans-Brown et al., 2021); and,
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
9
 an expert technical meeting, held on 16 December 2022, to share information and
expertise on this emerging issue with the Member States. This included
representatives from those working in national early warning systems, public health
agencies, laboratories, law enforcement, as well as other relevant experts (EMCDDA,
2022a)
Together, these responses are intended to strengthen situational awareness of this emerging
issue and to support preparedness and response measures at national and EU level related
to potential public health and social risks from this new market.
1.2 Background
Hexahydrocannabinol (6a,7,8,9,10,10a-hexahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6Hdibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-ol; HHC) is a SSC first described in 1940 (section 2.3). According to
laboratory studies in vitro, and in several animal species in vivo, HHC is reported to have
broadly similar effects to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the main psychoactive
substance in cannabis (section 2.5). The pharmacological and behavioural effects of HHC in
humans have not been studied, though recent anecdotal reports from consumers indicate
that its effects are similar to that of cannabis and Δ9-THC.
HHC is sold openly as a purportedly ‘legal’ replacement to cannabis and Δ9-THC. Marketing
and advertising often make direct comparison or allusions to similarities in effects between
the substances.
HHC is not scheduled under the 1961 and 1971 United Nations (UN) drug conventions. In
the EU, HHC is monitored as a NPS since 21 October 2022 under the terms of Regulation
(EC) No 1920/2006 and Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA (2022b).
HHC appears to have first been sold in the US in around September 2021, although the
precise date is unknown. HHC is one of a number of SSCs that have recently been sold
openly in the US as ‘legal’ replacements to cannabis and Δ9-THC, beginning with Δ8-
tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC) in 2019 (see box) (CANN, 2021; US CDC, 2021; Erickson,
2021; US FDA, 2022; Leafly Staff, 2021; Leas et al., 2022; Livingstone et al., 2022). This
new market is linked to:
 the legalisation of hemp cultivation in the US in 2018;
 subsequent abundant / surplus supply of hemp and cannabidiol (CBD) derived from
hemp that can be used as a precursor for SSCs; and,
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
10
 the interpretation by producers that cannabinoids derived from hemp are not
controlled under the US Federal Controlled Substances Act, so long as the final
product does not contain more than 0.3% Δ9-THC by dry weight (Leas, 2021; Fruth,
2022).
1.3 HHC situation in Europe
Unlike Δ8-THC, HHC is not specifically controlled under the international drug control system.
As of 31 March 2023, it is also not controlled in most EU Member States.
There is limited information on HHC in Europe. The substance was first identified in or
around May 2022 in a branded food product sold as a tincture called ‘CBN night’ that was
seized by Danish police. The tincture was marketed as a sleep aid. Laboratory analysis
Box. Δ8
-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8
-THC)
The first SSC to emerge on the market in the US as a result of the legalisation of hemp
was Δ8-THC in around September 2019 (CANN, 2021; Erickson, 2021; Leafly Staff,
2021; Leas, 2022). The cannabinoid is typically sold as vapes, hemp leaves that have
been sprayed or mixed with the cannabinoid (known as ‘flower’), and food products
(commonly known as ‘edibles’), such as brownies and sweets. Other products, such as
tinctures, are sold by some retailers.
Soon after its appearance on the market, reports of poisonings involving adults and
children began to increase (US CDC, 2021; US FDA, 2022; Livingston et al., 2022).
Typically, the effects of poisoning are similar to those reported for cannabis and Δ9-THC.
Overall, over a 14-month period between 1 January 2021(1) and 28 February 2022, US
poison centres reported 2 362 suspected Δ8-THC exposures. Of these, 58 % involved
adults and 41 % involved paediatric patients less than 18 years of age. Overall, 70 %
required health care facility evaluation, of which 8 % resulted in admission to a critical
care unit; 45 % of patients requiring health care facility evaluation were paediatric
patients; in part this may reflect caution by health professionals given the young age.
An analysis of search queries in Google search engine suggests that interest in Δ8-THC
is higher in states where cannabis has not been legalised for medical or recreational use
(Leas et al., 2022).
While Δ8-THC has also been identified occasionally in Europe (EMCDDA, 2022b), its
availability and use appear to be limited. The reason for this is unclear, however it may
be because it is specifically scheduled under the 1971 UN Convention and therefore
should be controlled at national level across Europe. However, it is important to note that
it is likely that Δ8-THC is undetected in some circumstances. Identifications to the
EMCDDA are also likely to be under-reported.

identified HHC and cannabinol (CBN). HHC was not declared on the packaging. The country
of manufacture on the labelling was listed as Switzerland (Figure 1) (EMCDDA, 2022c).

As of 31 March 2023, identifications of HHC have been reported by 20 Member States
(Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden)
and Norway (Figure 2). It has also been identified in Switzerland.

Since it was formally notified as an NPS, the EMCDDA has received reports of approximately
50 seizures through the EWS. Where reported, 25 seizures were from customs, 16 from the
police. In total, 70.7 kilograms of products containing HHC have been seized. This includes
28.8 kilograms of low-THC cannabis flower, 25.5 kilograms of resin, 15.5 kilograms of liquid,
0.7 kilograms of sweets, and 0.2 kilograms of unspecified herbal material. In addition, 95.6
litres of liquid have been reported and 809 disposable vapes were seized. Branded products
were reported in at least 13 seizures. Where known, the country of origin of these seized
products were reported as the United States (10 cases), the Netherlands (4), Spain (3),
Austria (1), Germany (1), Italy (1), Poland (1) and Switzerland (1).
Most of the seizures are relatively small-scale, however at least three seizures are indicative
of a potentially larger trade including production of finished products in Europe:
 In August 2022, Italian authorities seized just over 33 kilograms of material containing
HHC, comprised of low-THC cannabis flower and resin and bulk quantities of
oil/distillate. In addition, 68 kilograms of illicit cannabis containing Δ9-THC (and no
HHC) was also found in this seizure.
 In December 2022, Polish authorities seized 95 litres of HHC oil that originated from
the US (Figure 3). The oil was presumably intended to produce consumer products.
 In February 2023, German customs seized 10 kilograms of HHC liquid that were sent
from the Netherlands and en route to Italy. The liquid was reported to have originated
from the US.

US. It was seized in a joint operation between Polish Customs and Polish Police

Informal reports from some Member States and initial results from internet monitoring of the
surface web by the EMCDDA suggests that HHC’s availability and use in Europe is likely
much greater than suggested by seizures reported so far through the EWS.
A range of branded and unbranded products containing HHC are available in Europe. They
include:
 low-THC cannabis flower and resin, onto which HHC has been sprayed or mixed;
 ready-to-use disposable vape pens, e-liquids and e-liquid cartridges for use in
electronic cigarettes;
 food products, especially flavoured sweets (gummies and marshmallows) and
tinctures resembling food supplements; and,
 HHC oils (distillates).
Low-THC cannabis products containing HHC are marketed in a range of sophisticated,
attractive, brightly coloured, designs (Figure 4). In some cases, these are advertised as not
for human consumption. In other cases, they may be sold as unbranded products (Figure 5).
Low-THC cannabis flower containing HHC are also marketed using the names of popular
cannabis strains such as Afghan Kush, Amnesia, BubbleGum Kush, Strawberry Kush,
Pineapple Express, and Purple Haze, or mention or allude to the same effects as these
strains.

Importantly, low-THC cannabis flower and resin containing HHC have a similar look and
smell to illicit cannabis. Similar to the recent adulteration of low-THC cannabis with synthetic
cannabinoids (EMCDDA, 2022), it is possible that HHC may be deliberately or accidentally
mis-sold as, or used to adulterate, cannabis, THC, and CBD products. While information is
limited, case reports from countries in Europe suggest that HHC is already being mis-sold as
illicit cannabis. However, the overall size and scale of this practice is unknown.
Disposable vapes and cartridges are sold in attractive packaging similar to commercial
nicotine vapes and cartridges (Figure 6a and Figure 6b).

The size and scale of the retail market is unknown. Products are sold in a range of brick-andmortar and online shops, particularly those specialised in selling low-THC cannabis and CBD
products, as well as vaping products (‘smoke shops’). Initial indications from surface web
monitoring suggest that retailers can be found in or ship to most Member States. Producers,
retailers, and consumers may also buy bulk oils and finished products from suppliers in the
US and import them into Europe. In the latter case, this is supported by information from
customs seizures (see Figure 3).
Potentially, there could be a large demand for HHC products. These include people who use
cannabis as well as Δ9-THC and CBD products, as well as new consumers attracted to its
legal status. In the latter case, this includes young people and others inexperienced with drug
use. While there is no specific research on HHC, as noted above, in the United States,
interest in Δ8-THC, at least in terms of Google searches, was higher in states where
cannabis has not been legalised for medical or recreational use (Leas et al., 2022).
In some cases, ease of access to products, such as high street shops, may promote use.
Consumers may also be attracted to the different effects that HHC is claimed to have
compared to cannabis and other THC products. While the accuracy of these claims have not
been assessed, it includes assertions that HHC is ‘less intoxicating’, which has led to it being
described sometimes as ‘cannabis lite’ (not the same as the low-THC ‘cannabis light’
marketed primarily in Italy since about 2018 (1)). Vapes and sweets are also an easy and
discreet way of using HHC, especially in public settings. Vape cartridges are also supplied
using the standard universal 510-thread connector design, fitting many existing e-cigarettes
on the market.

Information on the retail prices of HHC products is currently limited. However, based on test
purchases and internet monitoring, they appear to be comparable with at least some illicit
cannabis products. For example, low-THC cannabis flower containing HHC sells for
approximately 6-10 EUR/g (depending on the reported strength of the product), which is
similar to the average cost of illicit cannabis herb in Europe (EMCDDA, 2020).
As of 31 March 2023, no analytically confirmed serious adverse events involving HHC have
been reported to the EMCDDA.
1.4 Other SSCs in Europe
Since HHC was first identified in May 2022, a further two SSCs have been identified on the
drug market in Europe: HHC acetate and hexahydrocannabiphorol (HHC-P).
In August 2022, HHC acetate (6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6a,7,8,9,10,10ahexahydrobenzo[c]chromen-1-yl) acetate was identified for the first time in Europe by
Hungary (EMCDDA, 2022d). As of the 31 March 2023, identifications have been reported by
3 Member States: Croatia, Estonia, and Hungary. HHC acetate is closely related to HHC and
likely hydrolysed to HHC in the body.
In November 2022, hexahydrocannabiphorol (3-heptyl-6a,7,8,9,10,10a-hexahydro-6,6,9-
trimethyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-ol) was identified for the first time in Europe by Slovenia
(EMCDDA, 2023). As of the 31 March 2023, identifications have been reported by 4 Member
States: Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, and Slovenia.
Both HHC acetate and HHC-P are sold in the same types of products as HHC and through
the same retailers.
Based on products currently available in the US, SSCs described in the scientific literature
and discussed on drug user online forums, a number of other SSCs with effects broadly
similar to cannabis and Δ9-THC may also emerge on the European drug market over time
(Stone, 2020).
1.5. Priority areas for research
The sudden emergence of HHC and its apparent rapid spread in the US and Europe have
posed unusual challenges to laboratories, public health, health professionals, law
enforcement, policy and decision-makers as well as to the public.
As for any NPS, many of the questions related to HHC and other SSCs that are posed by the
lack of data on the risks to individual health, risks to public health and social risks could be
answered through further research. Areas where additional information would be important
include studies on epidemiology (frequency and patterns of use, including studies that
examine the groups of people who use SSCs and risk behaviours); the market; chemical
profiling; extended pharmacological and toxicological profiling; metabolic pathways;
behavioural effects; acute and chronic toxicity; the potential interaction between HHC or
other SCCs and other substances; the abuse liability and dependence-producing potential;
and the public health and social risks associated with their use.
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
18
While HHC has been known for more than eight decades in scientific circles, no documented
human pharmacological or toxicological studies have been conducted.
From a pharmacological point of view, on one hand, the acute behavioural and psychological
effects of HHC are – or appear to be – very similar to those experienced by users of
cannabis and other Δ9-THC products. On the other hand, the novel and currently popular
forms of ingestion, such as by vaping or in edibles, might cause unexpected (psycho)toxicity
not typical of conventional cannabis products.
Investigating the pharmacokinetics, including the metabolism in humans, should be a priority.
Due to its unique chemical and physicochemical properties (2) the metabolism and excretion
of HHC could differ from that of Δ9-THC. Identification of the main human urinary
metabolite(s) is also important from forensic and clinical points of view.
Comparative pharmacology studies in vitro on the mode of action of HHC, including single
epimers (stereoisomers) as well as their mixtures, could be readily carried out. Likewise,
nonclinical animal studies should shed light on the similarities and differences with regard to
Δ9-THC.
Since HHC and other SSC products often contain other ingredients either as contaminants or
intentionally added cannabinoids, as well as diluents, it is important to monitor the market, for
example by test purchases, and characterise the composition of these products.
It is important to collect information on the origin of HHC and related substances and
products on the market, including identifying sites and the applied methods of the chemical
manufacture of HHC.
The emergence of hydrogenated derivatives of other (phyto)cannabinoids (for example
tetrahydrocannabigerol) on the drug market is anticipated, so continuous, systematic,
monitoring of the market is recommended. This may also include the need for test purchases
of new products and substances that emerge on the market.
Research on why such semi-synthetic products are appealing to users and to what extent
they compare to other cannabis-based products is also needed.

Section 2. Technical review on HHC and related substances
2.1 Summary
The appearance of the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (synthetic cannabinoids) in
‘Spice’- or ‘K2’-type ‘legal high’ products in around 2006 predicated the introduction of
products several times more potent than traditional herbal cannabis-based preparations
(EMCDDA, 2009). This phenomenon has become global and has been attributed to
advances in medicinal chemistry research and low-cost manufacturing typically by Asian
chemical companies. In recent years, however, the ‘cannabinoid market’ responded to
changes in legislation, in particular in the US, where, parallel to legalisation of cannabis for
recreational use in several jurisdictions, cultivation of industrial hemp re-started (‘Green
Rush’). As a consequence, hemp producers promptly looked for new hemp-based products,
including semi-synthetic cannabinoids made by simple – and low-cost – chemical
transformations of hemp extracts to legal or quasi-legal substances. In contrast to synthetic
cannabinoids, bioactivity, or potency, appears to have become a non-issue: these semisynthetic substances do not have to be – and, in fact they are often not – more potent than
the natural product Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). Low prices, novel products and forms
of consumption, attractive packaging, and aggressive, though often deceptive marketing on
the Internet combined with the increasing social acceptance of ‘cannabis use’, all seem to
contribute to this new phenomenon.
For several years, cannabidiol-containing products proliferated not only in the US but
globally. Recently, however, cannabidiol (CBD) is no longer simply a ‘product’ but has also
become a ‘precursor’ to several semi-synthetic cannabinoids, of which hexahydrocannabinol
(HHC) is just one of the latest. HHC appeared on the drug market in 2021. It was first
identified in Europe in or around May 2022 in Denmark and notified as a new psychoactive
substance through the EWS in October 2022 (EMCDDA, 2022b). Since then, a total of 20
Member States and Norway have identified the substances as part of the EWS. It has also
been identified in Switzerland.
The synthesis and biological (cannabimimetic) activity of HHC was first reported by research
laboratories eight decades ago. The current large-scale manufacturing of HHC is based on
low-THC hemp derived CBD-extract which is first transformed into a mixture of Δ8-THC and
Δ9-THC followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the THC isomer mixture into the final product.
Analysis of marketed products and seizures indicate that such substances contain two
stereoisomers (epimers) of HHC, the (9R)-HHC and (9S)-HHC) (or 9β-HHC and 9α-HHC,
respectively). Non-clinical studies and anecdotal reports have indicated that HHC, in
particular 9β-HHC, indeed has Δ9-THC-like pharmacological properties, though it appears to
have somewhat lower potency. Data on the metabolism of HHC in animals are scarce and
inadequate.
The human pharmacology of HHC has not been studied, and (immuno)analytical methods for
the rapid and unambiguous detection of HHC or its metabolites in urine are lacking.
Further research would be needed to explore the full biological activity spectrum of this
cannabinoid.

2.2. A brief history of recent hemp regulation in the United States
In the recent decade there has been a renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of
phytocannabinoids, and CBD in particular (Lewis, 2020; Parker et al., 2022). The
appearance in around 2019 on the drug market of semi-synthetic cannabinoids such as Δ8-
tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC) (Erickson, 2021; Karschner, 2021; Geci et al., 2022), and
subsequently HHC, however, can be attributed to legislative changes in the US.
Eighty-six years ago, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 imposed a heavy administrative burden
on the cultivation of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) (3), and legislations after World War II
essentially eliminated hemp production in the US (Cherney and Small, 2016). In the 2014
Farm Bill, the definition of industrial hemp allowed for hemp cultivation under very limited
circumstances. The situation however, changed with the enactment in December 2018 of the
Agriculture Improvement Act, or the 2018 Farm Bill (as it is more commonly known), which
facilitated the wide-scale cultivation of industrial or ‘low-THC’ (4) hemp by removing ‘hemp’
from the definition of ‘marijuana’ in the Controlled Substances Act 5 (US Public Law, 2018;
USDA, 2023). Such hemp varieties are relatively rich in CBD so the extraction of this
phytocannabinoid becomes feasible and thus economically attractive.
The 2018 Farm Bill has made a distinction between THC-rich ‘marijuana’ and low-THC hemp
as defined by the new definition of ‘hemp’ (7 USC 1639o, SEC. 297A):
“The term ‘hemp’ means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant,
including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids,
salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol
concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.”
The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was modified accordingly (US DoJ, 2020) and defining
the distinction between ‘marihuana’ and ‘hemp’:
16)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the term "marihuana" means all parts of the plant
Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from
any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or
preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin.
(B) The term "marihuana" does not include (i) hemp, as defined in section 1639o of title
7; or (ii) the mature stalks of such plant, fibre produced from such stalks, oil or cake
made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom),
fibre, oil, or cake, or the sterilised seed of such plant which is incapable of germination.”
(
3
) There are several names used in the scientific and popular literature for this plant. For example, in North America, ‘hemp’ is
commonly used for C. sativa varieties used for non-recreational purposes such as fibre production, while the term ‘marijuana’
(alternative spelling ‘marihuana’) is used for both the plant and its drug preparations used for recreational purposes. In addition,
the word ‘cannabis’ is also used in a very broad sense worldwide (Small, 2017; see also UNCTAD, 2022). A qualifying word,
such as in ‘industrial hemp’, ‘fibre-type hemp’, ‘hemp oil’, ‘medical marijuana’, and ‘medical cannabis’, is often added. The
indiscriminate use of ‘cannabis’ may cause confusion since the definition of cannabis in Article 1 of the Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol is as follows: ‘“Cannabis” means the flowering or fruiting tops of the
cannabis plant (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops) from which the resin has not been
extracted, by whatever name they may be designated.’ In Section 2 of this publication, unless otherwise noted, the term ‘hemp’
is used for Cannabis sativa.

TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
21
The CSA was also amended in Schedule I to specifically exclude ‘tetrahydrocannabinols
in hemp (as defined under section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946)’6
As a consequence, the inclusion of the terms ‘extract’ and ‘cannabinoids’ in the Farm Bill’s
definition of ‘hemp’ and the exclusion of that ‘hemp’ from the CSA definition of ‘marijuana’
has been suggested to allow for a wide interpretation of the law but appears to provide a
legal authorisation for using hemp extracts for a variety of purposes, including for the
manufacture of products containing SSCs.
Responding to a request from the Alabama Board of Pharmacy concerning the control status
of Δ8-THC under the Controlled Substances Act, the US Drug Enforcement Administration
stated in September 2021 (US DoJ, 2021):
“[C]annabinoids extracted from the cannabis plant that have a Δ9-THC concentration of
not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis meet the definition of “hemp” and thus
are not controlled under the CSA.”
Accordingly, this appears to have been interpreted by manufacturers that hemp-derived Δ8-
THC as well as other hemp-derived non-Δ9-THC tetrahydrocannabinol isomers are not
controlled under the Controlled Substances Act. However, the situation differs in US states
that introduced specific control of Δ8-THC and other semisynthetic cannabinoids.
A recently introduced bill (US House, 2022) now aims to modify the legislation to include all
tetrahydrocannabinol isomers in the definition of ‘hemp’ by placing a limit on their total
content:
“The term ‘hemp’ means …
(A) the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof
and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers
thereof… with a total tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 1 percent on
a dry weight basis, that is not intended for sale to consumers”.
“(B) hemp extract that ‘(i) is to be used in the making of a hemp product; ‘‘(ii) has not
been packaged as a finished product; ‘(iii) is not intended for sale to consumers; ‘(iv) has
a total tetrahydrocannabinol concentration that exceeds 1 percent on a dry weight
basis.”
The Bill also introduces the term ‘hemp product’:
“The term ‘hemp product’ means a finished product that … is derived from, or made by,
processing hemp; and … has a total tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more
than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.’’
Furthermore, the Bill specifically mentions three tetrahydrocannabinol isomers to be covered
by the proposed legislation:

TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances

“The term ‘total tetrahydrocannabinol concentration’ means the aggregate concentration
of delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, delta-10
tetrahydrocannabinol, and the optical isomers of such substances” (7).
The enactment of the Farm Bill, along with the large growth in CBD products, revitalised
hemp cultivation, with hemp production increased dramatically. By 2021, open area
cultivation of industrial hemp exceeded 21,800 ha of which 6,745 ha was devoted to floral
hemp (USDA, 2022) (8). Consequently, as supply in hemp products, including CBD,
increased, prices dropped. According to a recent special report on hemp (UNCTAD, 2022):
“The price of crude CBD hemp oil on the European market reached $931 per kg in
November 2021. CBD isolate [(9)] was sold at $952 per kg and $1,200 per kg in
November 2021 on the European and United States markets, respectively. However, a
significant fall in prices due to overproduction of hemp-derived CBD-containing products
has been observed since the overheating of the market in late 2019 and early 2020 in
the United States. This drop in prices rapidly spread to the European market causing
some turmoil in overall industrial hemp production.”
Due to the oversupply of CBD extracts and rediscovering that this phytocannabinoid could
serve a precursor to a range of semi-synthetic cannabinoids (SSCs), producers diversified
their market by converting CBD to other cannabinoids using procedures described in the
scientific literature decades ago. The first SSC was Δ8-THC (10) in a variety of forms, such as
oils for vaping, tinctures, herbal preparations, or gummy edibles. Soon after, its acetate
derivative (‘THC-O’) appeared on the market. More recently, a novel SSC,
hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) has emerged.
While the production and sale of SSC products was until recently considered to be a US
phenomenon, by mid-2022 the open sale of HHC products of unknown composition and/or
purity became noticeable in other countries as well.
2.3. Chemical and physical properties, methods and precursors used for
manufacture or extraction of HHC
2.3.1 Background
To date, 296 cannabinoids have been isolated from various strains of Cannabis sativa L.
(Lumír Hanuš, personal communication). It must be noted, however, that several of these
substances may be artefacts, that is degradation or transformation products formed from
genuine phytocannabinoids of biosynthetic origin under environmental conditions (oxygen,
heat, light, etc.) or during isolation or even analysis.
(
7
) Note that Δ6a,10a-THC, which is slightly psychoactive as a cannabimimetic (Hollister et al., 1987) is not included. The reason
for this omission could be that this isomer is not readily obtainable from CBD.
(
8
) For comparison, in Europe hemp was cultivated on ca. 32,000 ha in 2021 (EUROSTAT):
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/APRO_CPSH1__custom_4409454/default/table Accessed on 8 January 2023.
(

) CBD isolate is an extract that contains cannabidiol and essentially no other substances naturally present in hemp.
(
10) Though Δ8
-THC has been isolated from hemp, it might be an artefact resulting from the isomerization of the endocyclic
double bond of Δ9
-THC the thermodynamically more stable Δ8
 position (Hanuš et al., 2016).
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
23
Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC; 6a,7,8,9,10,10a-hexahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6Hdibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-ol) is a chemically stable cannabinoid which is not biosynthesised by the
plant. It was first prepared in the respective laboratories of Adams (Adams et al., 1940a) and
Todd (1940) in 1940. HHC is structurally similar to the well-studied phytocannabinoid Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), which is the main psychoactive substance in cannabis, yet
its human pharmacology is virtually unexplored. Being a hexahydro derivative, HHC is not
scheduled by the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, which only controls
tetrahydrocannabinol and their isomers. From around mid-2021, HHC has been sold openly
in a range of products in the US and subsequently Europe and elsewhere. Products include
low-THC cannabis (hemp) flower and resin onto which HHC has been sprayed or mixed with
HHC, vape products and edibles. This rapid emergence has required a comprehensive
appraisal of the available information on this simple and now readily available, yet almost
forgotten cannabinoid.
2.3.2 Names and structure
The nomenclature, the atom numbering in particular, of cannabinoids has changed over time.
The original numbering system used until the 1970s has a biogenetic background: it reflected
monoterpenoid biosynthetic origin of phytocannabinoids. This numbering has by now been
superseded by systematic (IUPAC) numbering based on the benzochromene, or
dibenzopyran, ring numbering system. This latter nomenclature is now generally accepted
and will be used throughout this technical review even when the original publication used the
monoterpenoid numbering. Since the present review relies in large part on early publications
using the ’old’ numbering it is useful to point out the differences between the two systems.
For comparison, Figure 8 shows the two numbering systems on the example of Δ9-THC.
FIGURE 8
The earlier used monoterpenoid numbering (left) and the current systematic (IUPAC)

Semi-synthetic HHC is typically a mixture of 9α- and 9β-methyl stereoisomers (epimers)
which have different pharmacological properties (Section 2.5). Compared to Δ9-THC, which
is susceptible to chemical (Pars and Razdan, 1971; Miller et al., 1982) and biochemical (Just

oxidation, though experimental evidence is lacking.
Molecular structures, molecular formulas, and molecular masses of HHC (unspecified
stereochemistry) and epimeric HHCs are shown in Figure 9. Since HHC has three
stereogenic carbon atom, eight stereoisomers with four pairs of enantiomers are possible.
The structures shown in Figure 9 depict HHC of unspecified stereochemistry and the two
diastereomers, or epimers, in which the configurations of the 6a and 10a carbon atoms are
identical to those of Δ9-THC. These epimers are the expected main components of HHCcontaining products manufactured from CBD-rich low-THC hemp extract.

2.3.3 Physical properties
HHC was first prepared around 1940 during investigations aimed at isolating the
psychoactive constituents of ‘marihuana’ and ‘hashish’ and to elucidate their chemical
structure. The lipophilic nature and chemical instability, the liability to isomerization in
particular, of the tetrahydrocannabinol constituents, and the lack of adequate analytical
techniques hampered progress. Thus, early studies involving HHC rarely worked with
stereochemically pure substances, hence the variations in the reported physicochemical and
biological characteristics.

Stability:
 According to a producer (18), the shelf-life of HHC of 96% purity is 6–12 months. It is
also noted that the amber oil “[a]fter exposure to oxygen, HHC may begin to slowly take on a
dark orange hue.”
2.3.3.1 Other physicochemical properties of pharmacological importance:
In general, phytocannabinoids are non-polar, lipophilic substances thus have low water
solubility. There is no specific information on the lipophilicity of HHC, but available data for
structurally related phytocannabinoids, such as cannabidiol and benzochromene
cannabinoids, including Δ9-THC, suggest high lipid solubility. Table 1 gives comparative data
on calculated and, when available, measured partition coefficients (19), affecting
pharmacokinetics. (Thomas et al., 1990). Another useful parameter in assessing brain
penetration of a substance is the calculated topological polar surface area (TPSA).

Inspection of the three-dimensional structure of HHC isomers reveals that the 9β epimer, that
is (9R)-HHC, where the C-11 methyl group is in equatorial position on the cyclohexane ring,
is essentially in the same position as the C-11 methyl of Δ9-THC. As seen in Figure 11, an
overlay of the optimised structures of the two HHC epimers and Δ9-THC indicates a perfect fit
for 9β-HHC and the phytocannabinoid, while in the case of the 9α epimer only the core ring
systems and the n-pentyl side chains can be superimposed, the axial C-11 methyl group
protrudes into the bottom face. (For a detailed structural analysis of the three cannabinoids,

2.3.4 Representative substances containing the hexahydrocannabinol core
The hexahydrobenzochromene scaffold is found in a few natural products and several
synthetic cannabinoids. Representative substances related to HHC isolated from hemp and
other natural sources are shown in Figure 12. Cannabiripsol (CBR) is the 9,10-dihydroxy
derivative of HHC and was isolated from a South African cannabis variety (Boeren et al.,
1979); it is most likely formed from Δ9-THC. Another group of closely related analogues were
isolated from the stem bark of the Amazonian liana Machaerium multiflorum of which
machaeriol A differs from HHC by the stereochemistry at the ring junction and by the side
chain (Muhammad et al., 2001).
Of the first synthetic analogues of HHC described in 1942 the n-hexyl homologue (Figure 12)
showed greatly improved potency in the dog ataxia test (Adams et al., 1942). A group of
compounds lacking one of the geminal methyl groups on the hexahydrobenzochromene core
but with branched homologous side chains was described in a patent (SmithKline, 1977).

Lilly Research Laboratories prepared and evaluated a series of 9-nor-hexahydrocannabinols
including nabilone and canbisol (Figure 12) of which the former eventually became a
medicine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy (24)
(Archer et al., 1986). In search for non-opioid analgesics, Pfizer researchers simultaneously
developed but did not commercialise CP-42,096 (Figure 12) (Johnson et al., 1981; Johnson
and Melvin, 1986; Compton et al., 1992). Both canbisol and CP-42,096 were ten-fold more
potent than morphine and about hundred-fold more potent than Δ9-THC as antinociceptive
drugs in mice and rats (Johnson and Melvin, 1986). Research along this structural type
afforded several potent analogues and eventually led to the conceptualisation of a
cannabinoid receptor model (Howlett et al., 1988).
Several known and newly synthesised hexahydrocannabinol analogues, including
machaeriol A as well as HHC and its lower homologue LYR-7 (25) (Figure 12), were
investigated as potential anticancer agents (Thapa et al., 2011).

2.3.5 Methods and chemical precursors used for the manufacture or extraction
Information on the specific manufacturing methods for the HHC currently available on the
market is lacking. Two basic approaches have been documented for the synthesis of HHC.
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
35
The first relies on chemical precursors obtained from botanical sources, that is hemp, C.
sativa; while the second possibility is to use total synthesis using other, small molecule
natural products or synthetic chemicals as starting materials. The first route is considered to
be practical for large-scale production of HHC, while the second has the advantage of
providing access to stereoisomeric variants as well as analogues of HHC.
2.3.5.1 Synthesis of HHC from phytocannabinoids obtained from C. sativa (hemp) extract
While details on the actual manufacture method of HHC is unknown, it is thought to rely on
industrial hemp-derived CBD, which has now become a commodity chemical (Section 2.2).
CBD-based manufacture of HHC is also inextricably connected to the production of Δ8-THC,
which emerged on the US market on its own around 2019 as a ‘legal’ alternative to its
controlled Δ9-isomer (Erickson, 2021; Karschner, 2021).
Accordingly, HHC is produced in two simple steps from CBD extracts. The first step involves
an acid-catalysed cyclisation (26),
(27) of CBD at elevated temperature to provide, as the main
product, the thermodynamically more stable (28) Δ8-THC, accompanied by isomeric Δ9-THC,
as well as a wide range of byproducts (Figure 13). The cyclisation can be affected by the use
of ethanolic solution of hydrogen chloride or phosphoric acid, zinc chloride, sulfamic acid or
pyridine hydrochloride as catalyst (Adams et al., 1940a) (29). The ratio of the two THC
isomers as well as the amount and chemical nature of the by-products depend on the
reaction conditions (Section 5.6). In a recently patented method, the use of either ptoluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) or boron trifluoride catalyst under optimised conditions yields
products highly enriched either in Δ8-THC or Δ9-THC, respectively (Webster et al., 2008). A
recent in-depth study has investigated product composition of the intramolecular cyclisation
of CBD using a range of protic acids and Lewis acids in different solvents (Marzullo et al.,
2020). In short, CBD is a ‘pre-precursor’ with Δ8-THC being the immediate precursor to HHC.
FIGURE 13

-THC and Δ9
-THC from CBD. The ratio of the main
products and contaminants depends on the nature of catalyst, solvent and
temperature
(
26) It is of historical interest that such an acid-catalysed intramolecular ring closure was proposed by Cahn in 1933 (Cahn,
1933), many years before the actual structures of CBD or THC were elucidated.
(
27) This process is colloquially called ‘isomerization’ and has been described in detail in various popular books already in the
early 1970s (Hoye, 1973; Todd, 1974; Starks, 1977).
(
28) The difference in the stability of the two isomeric cannabinoids has been demonstrated by quantum chemical calculations
(Reggio et al., 1989) and experiments (Miller et al., 1982).
(
29) For the cyclisation of the CBD homologue cannabidivarinol (CBDV) triisobutylaluminum has also been used (Tesfatsion et
al., 2022).
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
36
The synthesis of HHC of unspecified stereochemistry by catalytic hydrogenation of
’tetrahydrocannabinol’ at atmospheric pressure was first published in 1940. For the
reduction, platinum oxide (Adam’s catalyst) (Adams et al., 1940a; Adams, 1947; Gaoni and
Mechoulam, 1966a; Hively et al., 1966), or palladium on charcoal catalysts have been used
(Adams et al., 1940a; Harvey et al., 1980; Casati et al., 2022; Collins et al., 2022). The
method relies on the availability of Δ8/Δ9-THC and is suitable for large-scale production of
HHC. (Crude Δ8/Δ9-THC mixtures are now readily available by acid-catalysed cyclisation of
CBD obtained from low-THC industrial hemp, see Figure 13.) Depending on the reaction
conditions, one of the epimers may dominate in the final product.
It has been observed that the catalytic hydrogenation of Δ9-THC using platinum catalyst
Adam’s catalyst affords the 9α-HHC and 9β-HHC isomers in approximate a 1:2 ratio, while
the use of palladium/charcoal catalyst yielded the two epimers in a 1:1 ratio (Skinner et al.,
1979) or in a 3:7 ratio (Casati et al., 2022). In contrast, hydrogenation of Δ8-THC using
platinum oxide catalyst favours the production of the axial 9α-HHC isomer over the equatorial
9β-HHC isomer in a 3:1 ratio (Gaoni and Mechoulam, 1966a; Archer et al., 1970; see also
Turner at al., 1973) (30) (Figure 14).
Ethanol or acetic acid have been the most widely used solvent for such catalytic
hydrogenations.
(
30) In the original paper (Gaoni and Mechoulam, 1966a) the notations for the structure of the 9α (axial C-11 methyl) and 9β
(equatorial C-11 methyl) appear to be reversed. In the text and a subsequent review the opposite – and correct – configuration
is given (Mechoulam, 1973) which is in line with another structural study (Archer et al., 1970).

Recent anecdotal information suggests that the large-scale hydrogenation of the THC
isomeric mixture is rather unpredictable and the ratio of the 9α and 9β epimers in the product
may vary from batch to batch (31).
In connection with studies on the isomerizations and transformations of cannabinoids (see
also Section 3.6), the synthesis of (+)-HHC (32) was accomplished by a p-TSA-catalyzed
cyclisation of ‘unnatural’ 1,2-dihydrocannabidiol (‘1,2-dihydro-CBD’) prepared from boron
tribromide-catalyzed rearrangement of (+)-cis-HHC (33) (Figure 15) (Uliss et al., 1978).

During studies aimed at the synthesis of Δ7-THC (Mechoulam et al., 1973), the two C-11
methyl epimers were also prepared from the 8α/β-tosyloxy derivatives of HHC by LiAlH4
reduction while 9β-HHC was obtained from the 8-keto-HHC by Wolff-Kishner reduction (34).
2.3.5.2 Total syntheses of HHC
The first, though non-stereoselective total syntheses, were simultaneously pursued in the
research laboratories of Adams in the US and Todd in England around 1940. Both research
groups used essentially the same synthetic route as shown in Figure 16. Condensation of
racemic ethyl 5-methylcyclohexanone-2-carboxylate with olivetol in the presence of either
phosphoryl chloride (Adams et al., 1940b; Adams et al., 1941b; Adams et al., 1941c) or
concentrated sulphuric (Ghosh et al., 1940a, Ghosh et al., 1940b; Powell and Bembry, 1940)
gave the corresponding tetrahydrobenzochromenone, which upon treatment with excess
methyl magnesium iodide yielded – as originally suggested – the corresponding
tetrahydrodibenzopyran (i.e., Δ6a(10a)-THC). Catalytic hydrogenation of the latter THC isomer
afforded HHC with undefined stereochemistry. However, the intermediates obtained by this
procedure were later shown to contain not only the claimed benzochromenone derivative but
also its double bond isomer (in square brackets in Figure 16) (Claussen and Korte, 1966a;
Claussen and Korte, 1966b). Consequently, the Δ6a(10a)-THC was accompanied by a
substantial amount of the Δ10(10a)-THC isomer (in square brackets) in the end product
(Claussen and Korte, 1966a; Claussen and Korte, 1966b). Regardless of the position of the
C=C double bond, hydrogenation of the two THC isomers afforded HHC albeit with
undefined stereoisomeric composition.
(
34) The tosyloxy and keto derivatives of HHC were obtained from Δ8
-THC by a multistep route.

FIGURE 16
Synthesis of a stereoisomeric mixture of HHC (Adams et al., 1941a; Adams et al.,

Following the route which is based on a Diels-Alder reaction of isoprene on an appropriately
substituted cinnamic acid derivative (Adams and Carlin, 1943; Jen et al., 1967), a patent
described the synthesis of HHC though no experimental details were given (Figure 17)
(Hughes et al., 1971). Note that exposure of the cyclohexenecarboxylic acid to an excess of
methylmagnesium iodide at 165 °C resulted in the formation of the requisite tertiary alcohol
with concomitant demethylation of the two methoxy groups. The racemic cyclohexene–
carboxylic intermediate, having the two rings in trans configuration, could be resolved into its
enantiomers using (+)-1-(2-naphthyl)ethylamine, thus this route, at least in theory, could
provide access to stereoenriched HHC isomers and related analogues.

2.3.5.3 Synthesis of non-racemic HHC non-cannabinoid chiral starting materials
Stereoselective syntheses involving intramolecular hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of transient oquinonemethides have been developed (Tietze et al., 1982; Marino and Dax, 1984; Casiraghi
et al., 1986; Cornia et al., 1989; Murphy et al., 1992a; Murphy et al., 1992b; Wang et al.,
2000; Lee and Xia, 2008).
The use of the intramolecular hetero-Diels-Alder reaction for the highly efficient
stereoselective synthesis of (–)-(6aR,9R,10aR)-HHC, that is 9β-HHC, was first reported by
the Tietze-group (Tietze et al., 1982) (35). As depicted in Figure 18, condensation of the
readily available (R)-citronellal with 5-pentylcyclohexane-1,3-dione (Focella et al., 1977)
generates a transient o-quinonemethide which upon intramolecular cycloaddition affords the
appropriately substituted decahydrodibenzopyranone. The tricyclic ketone was then

production of HHC enantiomers.

aromatised in two steps via selenium intermediates to provide 9β-HHC. The ‘unnatural’
enantiomer (+)-(6aS,9S,10aS)-HHC can also be synthesised similarly using (S)-citronellal.

reaction thus eliminate the aromatisation step that involves noxious selenium reagents
(Marino and Dax, 1984; Casiraghi et al., 1986; Cornia et al., 1989; Lu et al., 1992; Murphy et
al., 1992a; Murphy et al., 1992b; Wang et al., 2000; Lee and Xia, 2008). Of these, the most
elegant and economic synthetic method provides access to 9β-HHC in a single step (Figure
19). Thus, cyclocondensation of (R)-citronellal with olivetol is facilitated by either
diethylaluminum chloride (Et2AlCl) (Casiraghi et al., 1986; Cornia et al., 1989; Andersson et
al., 2011) or ethylenediamine diacetate/triethylamine (EDDA/TEA) (Lee and Xia, 2008) leads
to 9β-HHC in high chemical yields (>85%) and high stereochemical purity (>76%). It is
remarkable that the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction proceeds with 100% stereocontrol
exerted by the single chiral centre of (R)-citronellal.

The (6aS,9S,10aS) enantiomer of HHC has also been prepared by the above methods using
(S)-citronellal as starting material (Marino and Dax, 1984; Casiraghi et al., 1986; Cornia et
al., 1989; Lee and Xia, 2008; Lee, 2010; Andersson et al., 2011).
The Et2AlCl-based method has also been used for the synthesis of HHC homologues such
as one lacking the C-11 methyl group (11-nor-HHC), and the C-9 geminal dimethyl analogue
of HHC (Andersson et al., 2011).
A related intramolecular hetero-Diels-Alder reaction-based approach to (±)-HHC has also
been reported (Inoue et al., 1990).
2.3.6. Other chemical aspects
2.3.6.1 Synthesis of cis-9β-HHC
The first isolation of Δ9-cis-tetrahydrocannabinol (cis-THC) from marijuana plants seized in
the US was reported in 1977 (Smith and Kempfert, 1977). More recently, two enantiomeric
cis-THCs, that is (6aS,10aR)-Δ9-THC and (6aR,10aS)-Δ9-THC have been isolated from
several hemp varieties cultivated in Europe for fiber production (Schafroth et al., 2021). In
both the American and European cases, the plants rich in cis-THC were of low-THC but highCBD containing chemotypes. The biosynthetic precursor of cis-THC, that is cis-Δ9-tetra–
hydrocannabinolic acid (cis-Δ9-THCA) has also been reported recently (Tolomeo et al.,
2022).
The synthesis of cis-HHC stereoisomers had already been described before the isolation
from hemp the cis isomer of its unsaturated counterpart, Δ9-THC. The cis-HHC epimers were
prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of the corresponding synthetic cis-Δ9-THC (Gaoni and
Mechoulam, 1968; Uliss et al., 1978) or, alternatively, obtained from either Δ6a,7-THC or
Δ6a,10a-THC (Arnone et al., 1975a). Once again, it was found that the ratio of the HHC
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
43
epimers depended on the nature of the catalyst: hydrogenation of cis-Δ9-THC over PtO2 gave
a 94:6 isomeric mixture of the 9α and 9β epimers, respectively. Hydrogenation using Pd on
carbon catalyst reversed the ratio with the 9β epimer predominating as determined by gas
chromatography (Figure 20) (Uliss et al., 1978).
FIGURE 20
Synthesis of cis-HHC epimers from cis-THC (Uliss et al., 1978)
The stereochemistry of the isomerization of cis-HHC to trans-HHC has been studied in detail
(Uliss et al., 1978).
Since CBD, the key precursor for the synthesis of HHC, has become readily available in
recent years, the synthetic routes described in the previous paragraphs and shown in
Figures 15–18 and 20 are only of theoretical interest, although they may be useful for the
synthesis of analogues of HHC, including radiolabelled derivatives, as well as for the
preparation of metabolites of HHC. However, the one-step method depicted in Figure 19
offers an excellent route to substances with a hexahydrocannabinol core. For example, the
use of readily accessible olivetol homologues, including branched chain ones, may provide
hexahydro analogues that are hardly accessible from natural sources.
2.3.6.2 Synthesis of the metabolite 11-OH-HHC and the metabolite-like 11-nor-9-COOHHHC
Several reports have described the synthesis of established or potential metabolites of HHC
either as standards for pharmacokinetic studies or to investigate their biological activity (for
metabolism of HHC, see Section 2.5.5).

The three reported multistep syntheses of the active cannabimimetic metabolite 11-OH-HHC
rely on known cannabinoids (Figure 21). Epoxidation of Δ11-THC acetate followed by
reduction using DIBAL-H yielded 11-OH-Δ8-THC and a mixture of the 9α and 9β epimers of
11-OH-HHC (Razdan et al., 1973). Hydroboration of the same precursor afforded an
approximately 1:1 mixture of the two epimers of 11-OH-HHC (Skinner et al., 1979). In the
third method, catalytic hydrogenation of the methyl ester of 11-nor-9-COOH-Δ8-THC acetate
led to the separable mixture of the 9α-HHC and 9β-HHC epimers in 54% and 34% yields,
respectively, which were then reduced by LiAlH4 to the respective 11-OH-9α-HHC and 11-
OH-9β-HHC metabolites (Mechoulam et al., 1980).

Deuterium-labelled 11-OH-HHC epimers have also been reported (Yang et al., 1991).
Following a route similar to the one shown in Figure 17 (Hughes et al., 1971), an
organocatalysis-based asymmetric synthesis of metabolite 11-OH-9β-HHC has recently been
reported (Maurya and Appayee, 2020). As outlined in Figure 22, the multistep synthesis is
based on a proline-catalysed inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction and provides

While HHC is principally a semi-synthetic cannabinoid, it may also co-occur with cannabinol
in low amount in cannabis samples (Turner et al., 1973; Garrett et al., 1978; Qureshi et al.,
2012; Basas-Jaumandreu et al., 2020). It is thought to be formed from Δ9-THC by
disproportionation as shown in Figure 23. It has been proposed that traces of acids
(chloroform solvent, silicic acid in glassware or TLC) catalyse the formation of free radicals at
the C-10a benzylic carbon atom leading to disproportionation of the phytocannabinoid into
HHC and CBN (Turner et al., 1973; Garrett et al., 1978). Such a free radical initiated redox
disproportionation has been described in a 1,2-dihydroquinoline series (Muren and
Weissman, 1971).

Proposed scheme for the disproportionation of Δ9-THC to HHC epimers and CBN
In liver extract of mice treated with the shorter ethyl homologue of THC the formations of the
ethyl homologues of HHC and CBN have been reported raising the possibility of the
occurrence of such a disproportionation also in vivo (Brown and Harvey, 1991).
Traces of HHC have also been shown to be formed from CBD by photochemical degradation
(Seccamani et al., 2021; Franco et al., 2022).

different techniques (Figure 24) (Stothard et al., 2022).

The results of an exhaustive analysis of the relationship between the chemical structure and
GC retention time of 25 common cannabis constituents and 45 synthetic cannabinoids,
including HHC and its n-propyl homologue have been published (HHCV) (Vree et al., 1972b).
The infrared spectra of the two epimers are similar but not superimposable and some
characteristic differences can be seen in the fingerprint region. For example, gas

The fragmentation pattern in the mass spectra of the 9α and 9β epimers of HHC are virtually
identical (Cayman, 2022a, Cayman, 2022b); GC-MS or HPLC-MS methods require analytical
standards for stereochemical analysis of an actual sample.
Proton NMR spectroscopy might also be useful in the discriminating between the epimers.
Solvent effects have been noted for the chemical shift of the C-10 and C-10a protons
adjacent to the phenolic moiety (Archer et al., 1970). Also useful are 13C NMR spectra in
distinguishing between the 9α and 9β stereoisomers since chemical shifts of the the carbon
atoms of the cycloalkane fragment are different for the two epimers (Collins et al., 2023)
(Table 3). With the exception of C6a, the chemical shift of all carbon atoms of the
cycloalkane moiety 9β epimer are shifted downfield.

Recent analyses of three different large-scale law enforcement seizures, namely low-THC
cannabis flower, hashish-type resins and oils, demonstrate the use of GC-MS analysis in the
estimation of HHC epimer ratio in the three different matrices. The seizures were made in
Italy in August 2022 and reported to the EMCDDA in November 2022. As the graph in Figure
25 indicates, the combined concentrations of the two HHC epimers ranged from 8.4% (herbal
material) to 32.3% (oil). The ratio of the two isomers in the samples varied from 1:1.2
(HASHISH_2381) to 1.5:1 (OIL_1983), suggesting that the 9α and 9β epimers occurred in
roughly equal amounts in the samples (the actual GC peaks were not assigned to the
epimers).

Information of the detection of HHC or its putative human metabolites by immunoassay is
scarce and originate from decades-old studies.
A radioimmunoassay (RIA) method for the specific detection of Δ9-THC and other
cannabinoids and some of their metabolites was developed using antibodies raised in sheep
against Δ9-THC O-hemisuccinate covalently bound via the free carboxylic group to bovine
serum albumin (Williams et al., 1978). In the cross-reactivity assay, Δ9-THC, Δ8-THC, Δ9,11-
THC, CBN, 11-OH-Δ9-THC, 8α-OH-Δ9-THC, 11-OH-CBN, 11-nor-9-COOH-Δ9-THC, 11-nor9-COOH-CBN, as well as HHC (36) at the same 0.6 ng/mL blood plasma concentration
equally inhibited tritium-labelled Δ9-THC binding by 50%. Likewise, a similar RIA method
(
36) The ratio of the 9α and 9β epimers was not stated.
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
53
developed for the detection of tricyclic cannabinoids did not discriminate between Δ9-THC,
Δ8-THC, 11-OH-Δ8-THC, CBN, and 8α-OH-HHC, a metabolite of HHC (Teale et al., 1975).
Studies carried out in the 1980s indicate substantial cross-reactivity of 11-nor-9β-carboxyHHC, a potential but hitherto not reported metabolite of HHC, in an immunoassay developed
for the detection for the primary THC metabolite 11-nor-9-COOH-THC (Jones et al., 1984;
Jones et al., 1985). Specifically, in a cannabinoid radioimmunoassay designed for the urinary
detection of the carboxylic acid metabolite of Δ9-THC (Abuscreen®) the metabolite-like
synthetic 11-nor-9β-COOH-HHC was found to show substantial cross-reactivity while the 9αcarboxy epimer was less reactive in the assay; of the two ‘intact’ HHC epimers only the 9β
isomer exhibited appreciable though low cross-reactivity (Jones et al., 1984).
Another early study reported on the cross-reactivity of three commercial immunoassays
developed for the detection the carboxylic acid metabolite of THC in urine (Jones et al.,
1985). Table 4 shows the cross-reactivity observed for representative cannabinoids and their
known or presumed metabolites in a homogeneous enzyme multiplied immunoassay (EMIT)
and two radioimmunoassays (RIA-I and RIA-II). Notably, the metabolite-like carboxylic acid
derivatives of HHC exhibit high cross-reactivities in all three immunoassays developed for
the urinary detection of the THC metabolite 11-nor-9-COOH-Δ9-THC. This indicates that
current immunoassays designed for THC metabolites detect the carboxylic acid metabolite of
HHC only if it is formed in the human body (hitherto only monohydroxylated metabolites of
HHC have been identified; see Section 2.5.5). The higher, though still moderate crossreactivity of the 9β- HHC compared to the reactivity of the 9α epimer in these assays is
conspicuous. Furthermore, though relevant human data are lacking, the moderate-to-high
cross-reactivity of the 11-hydroxylated metabolites of Δ8/Δ9-THC suggests that the
structurally related 11-OH-HHC, an established metabolite of HHC in the mouse (vide infra)
and probably occurs in humans who consumed HHC, might show positive reaction in such
immunoassays.

and 9β-HHC in the assays involving RIA-II.

2.3.8 Dosage regimens
2.3.8.1 Pharmaceutical information and route of administration and dosage
Based on the marketed products, law enforcement seizures, collected samples, and
anecdotal reports in Internet forums, the typical forms of administration are smoking low-THC
cannabis on which HHC is sprayed, vaping e-liquids for electronic cigarettes or other vaping
devices, and eating food products, such as tinctures and edibles (e.g. sweets). If known, the
actual composition and HHC-content of these products varies. HHC products are often
flavoured.
There are no relevant dose-response studies in humans. It may be assumed that HHC
preparations containing predominantly the more active 9β epimer elicit similar activity as Δ9-
THC preparations albeit somewhat larger dosages may need to be ingested. Due to the lack
of pharmacokinetic studies, it is not possible to discern the contribution of the epimeric
bioactive 11-OH-HHC metabolites to the overall pharmacological effects caused by the
consumption of HHC-containing products.
2.4. Legitimate use of HHC
Based on available information in the literature, HHC does not appear to be an active
ingredient in any human or veterinary medicinal product.
It appears that the current legitimate use of HHC is restricted to clinical and forensic
casework as well as scientific research. For example, HHC has been used as an internal
standard in Δ9-THC pharmacokinetic studies by GC/MS analysis (Fenimore et al., 1973; Wall
and Brine, 1979).
However, it is possible that further research with HHC, having similar but not identical
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics to Δ9-THC, may discover unique and
therapeutically useful pharmacological properties.
2.5. Pharmacological and toxicological properties of HHC
2.5.1 Summary
Information from scientific research on human pharmacology, including behavioural effects of
HHC is currently unavailable. The biological activity of HHC has been studied in several
animal species since the 1940s but, due to the unknown purity or composition of the
substance used in early investigations, the results of some of these studies is difficult to
interpret. Inter-laboratory variations in the bioassays – some of which later turned out to be
inadequate for cannabimimetic activity – also complicates the assessment of the results of
early studies. Nevertheless, later work with chemically well-characterised substances have
consistently revealed that the cannabimimetic effects observed both in vivo and in vitro
resides mainly in the 9β-HHC isomer.

There have been several publications on the biological activity of HHC since the first
synthesis in 1940 (Adams et al., 1940a). Most of the reported studies examined the
cannabimimetic effects of HHC in animals. A chronological summary of animal studies is
shown in Table 5. There is a paucity of relevant studies in vitro, and the results of various
investigations in vitro will be given in Table 8.
For a discussion of structure-activity relationships in a series of homologues, see Section
2.6.1.
2.5.2.1 Data from animal experiments in vivo
Several animal assays have been developed to study the ‘marijuana-like’ or cannabimimetic
effects of cannabinoids. Studies with HHC have used the following test: corneal reflex in
rabbit eye, dog ataxia, monkey behaviour, mouse tetrad test, and discriminative stimulus in
rats and pigeons. Additional studies investigated the therapeutic potential of HHC. Early
investigations used the readily available isomeric mixtures of HHC, but recent studies
focused on the more potent 9β isomer. Table 5 provides a summary of the results of these
nonclinical laboratory studies in chronological order. Data for the monohydroxylated 11-OHHHC metabolite are also shown.

One of the first assays used to evaluate the marijuana-like properties of cannabinoids was
testing for the loss of corneal reflex in rabbits (Gayer test) (39) (Russell et al., 1941).
Intravenous injection of an acetone solution of 5 mg/kg of HHC of unknown isomeric
composition provoked corneal areflexia of the same degree as injection of 1 mg/kg
”tetrahydrocannabinol” (obtained from CBD and having an optical rotation of –165º).
Comparative assessments using the dog ataxia assay (40) of ‘tetrahydrocannabinol’ (‘THC’)
preparations administered via intravenous injection have been reported in the early 1940s
(Adams et al., 1940c; Adams et al., 1942; Loewe, 1944). An initial publication reported that
the mean value of potency of HHC (optical rotation –70º) was 0.32 relative to a ‘THC’
preparation obtained from CBD by cyclisation under mild acidic conditions, and ~0.4 relative
to a ‘THC’ preparation obtained from CBD by cyclisation under harsh acidic conditions
(
39) In this test the corneal surface is touched lightly with the tip of a pen; upon intravenous pre-treatment with a cannabinoid
causing corneal analgesia / anaesthesia the wink reflex of the animal partially or completely abolished (corneal areflexia).
However, this test is not considered to be relevant to the psychotomimetic effects of cannabis observed in humans thus has
been abandoned.
(
40) The dog ataxia test is a simple yet sensitive semi-quantitative assay that has been used for a century to predict
cannabimimetic activity of a substance in humans.

(Adams et al., 1940c). (Based on the respective optical rotations of the two
‘tetrahydrocannabinol’ starting materials as –165º and –240º, it is reasonable to assume that
the former ‘THC’ preparation consisted mainly of Δ9-THC, while the latter was mainly Δ8.-
THC (41). Subsequently, the same group reported that the potency of HHC was 0.52 relative
to ‘THC’ (Adams et al., 1942; Loewe, 1944).
An extensive structure-activity relationship study carried out with rhesus monkeys as suitable
model animals included both the 9α and 9β epimers of HHC (Edery et al., 1971; Mechoulam
et al., 1980). The drugs were administered intravenously, and the behavioural pattern of the
monkeys was assessed using Norton’s scoring sheet (Norton, 1957). The data, represented
as a graph in Figure 26, indicate that 9β-HHC with the C-11 methyl group in equatorial
position is considerably more active than the 9α (axial) isomer. Specifically, the 1 mg/kg dose
of 9β-HHC caused severe stupor and ataxia, full ptosis, immobility, crouched posture lasting
for more than three hours and absence of reaction to external stimuli, while the 9α epimer
was less potent even at the 5.0 mg/kg dose, the highest dose tested. For comparison, a 0.5
mg/kg dose of Δ9-THC elicited behavioural and somatic changes with similar high scores as
observed for the 1 mg/kg dose of 9β-HHC. Furthermore, the psychopharmacological activity
of Δ8-THC and 9β-HHC appeared to be comparable in this investigation. These behavioural
experiments with rhesus monkeys revealed that the cannabimimetic activity resides mainly, if
not solely, in the laevorotatory 9β-HHC, that is (–)-(6aR,9R,10aR)-HHC, being about half as
active as Δ9-THC.

sheet. The graph was constructed on published semi-quantitative data (Edery et al.,

(
41) An authoritative review, however, designates the ’tetrahydrocannabinol’ tested by the Adams group as Δ6a,10a-THC, the
racemic form of which was shown to be several times less potent than Δ9
-THC in rhesus monkeys (Mechoulam and Edery,
1973).

A series of tetrahydrocannabinol and hexahydrocannabinol derivatives were evaluated in
mice for their effects on spontaneous locomotor activity, postural arrest, body temperature as
measured by rectal hypothermia, and pain sensitivity in the hot plate assay (Skinner et al.,
1979). As the estimated ED50 values shown in Table 6 indicate HHC was the least potent
substance being by an order of magnitude less active than any of the compounds in three of
the assays. Unlike Δ9-THC, the only drug exhibiting antinociception in the hot plate assay,
none of the hexahydrocannabinol analogues affected pain sensation. Curiously, 11-OHHHC, an established metabolite of HHC in the mouse, was essentially as potent as Δ9-THC
in the other three assays.

Based on the serendipitous findings that a population of New Zealand White rabbits exhibited
behavioural convulsions when given low intravenous doses of Δ9-THC, the cannabimimetic
property of a series of cannabinoids was studied using this model (Consroe et al., 1982).
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
60
Compared to Δ9-THC at the 0.05 mg/kg dose, both Δ8-THC and HHC were half as active as
the genuine natural product; neither cannabidiol nor olivetol were active in this model.
In a study examining the therapeutic potential of a series of cannabinoids in the treatment of
glaucoma neither 9α-HHC nor 9β-HHC lowered the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the rabbit at
the 1.0 mg/kg intravenous dose; in comparison, Δ9-THC at the same dose significantly
lowered IOP, for example, by 24% four hours after treatment (ElSohly et al., 1984).
The 9α and 9β epimers of 11-OH-HHC, the monohydroxylated metabolites of HHC, were
tested for cannabimimetic activity by drug discrimination studies (42) in rats and pigeons
(Järbe et al., 1986). The rats and pigeons were trained to discriminate between the presence
or absence of Δ9-THC in water or grain, respectively. The results of substitution tests with the
11-OH-HHC epimers are shown in Table 7. As the ED50 values indicate, 11-OH-9β-HHC,
code-name ’(–) NL-105’, was severalfold more potent in rats than Δ9-THC, while the 9α
epimer, code-name ’(–) NL-106’, was inferior to the 9β epimer. These differences were more
marked in pigeons where, for example, the 9β epimer of the HHC metabolite was about 17
times as potent as Δ9-THC when assessed 0.5 h post-injection. The results of this study
confirm the superiority of the 9β metabolite epimer over the 9α epimer as a cannabimimetic
drug. The results are also in line with earlier studies indicating that the 11-OH-Δ9-THC
metabolite of Δ9-THC is more potent than its parent cannabinoid in rat and pigeon
discriminatory models (Järbe and McMillan, 1980).

When ascertained, the formation of the bioactive 11-hydroxylated metabolite of HHC in
humans is of pharmacological as well as of forensic importance.
Although HHC has not been investigated in such a discriminatory paradigm, the above
results suggest that the human behavioural (cannabimimetic) effects of its 9β epimer would
be qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of Δ9-THC.
As mentioned before, scientific publications on the effect of HHC in humans could not be
identified.
2.5.2.2 Data in vitro
Prior to the identification of the cannabinoid receptor, a study reported the discovery of a
high-affinity cannabinoid binding protein in rat brain membrane preparations using the
hydrophilic 5’-trimethylammonium Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (TMA) and its radiolabelled
derivative [3H]TMA (Nye et al., 1985). The most potent inhibitor of the specific [3H]TMA
binding, as characterised by the binding affinity constants Ki, was the behaviourally inactive
cannabigerol (Ki = 8.3 nM), while for 9β-HHC the Ki value was 19 nM. In comparison, Δ9-THC
and Δ8-THC were somewhat less potent (respective Ki values were 27.3 and 32.9 nM).
However, it was noted that some behaviourally inactive cannabinoids, such as enantiomeric
THCs and CBD, also inhibited [3H]TMA binding indicating that this particular binding site do
not mediate characteristic effects of psychoactive cannabinoids.
An investigation studying the interaction of a series of cannabinoids with cloned human CB1
and CB2 cannabinoid receptors reported only semiquantitative data for 9α-HHC and 9β-HHC
(Andersson et al., 2011). The cannabinoid receptor activation by the test compounds were
presented as a percentage of the forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in the presence of
vehicle control (5% ethanol). At the 100 μM screening concentration 9α-HHC was found to
activate the hCB1 and hCB2 receptors by about 60% and about 15%, respectively. At the
same large concentration, 9β-HHC was found to activate hCB1 and hCB2 receptors by about
55% and about 30%, respectively, thus no substantial difference between the two HHC
epimers were observed in this assay. No data were reported for Δ9-THC, but Δ8-THC
activated hCB1 and hCB2 receptors by about 57% and 40%, respectively, at the screening
concentration.
A very recent investigation reported by the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine to
the EMCDDA (43) in vitro used transfected cells expressing the CB1-receptor to compare
(9R)-HHC (9β-HHC) and JWH-018, a well-studied synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist
(44). In this receptor activation assay (9R)-HHC was shown to be a partial agonist with an
EC50 (45) of 144 nM with a moderate efficacy (Emax = 37% relative to JWH-018); JWH-018
was about three-times more potent (EC50 = 44.0 nM).

A study discussed above also investigated the effect of the two HHC epimers on hTRPA1 ion
channel activation (46) (Andersson et al., 2011). However, only area-under-the-curve (AUC)
values were calculated from concentration–response curves for most of the test substances.
A comparison of the AUC values indicates that 9β-HHC is about 0.85 times as potent as Δ9-
THC, while 9α epimer is less than half as active; Δ8-THC is about 0.4 times as potent as Δ9-
THC in activating TRPA1 channels (see also Table 8).
The binding of selected cannabinoids including HHC, to opioid receptor preparations isolated
from rat brain has also been investigated (Vaysse et al., 1987). Of the compounds, Δ9-THC,
Δ8-THC, CBD and 9β-HHC were found to be the most potent cannabinoids in inhibiting the
binding of the mu receptor selective opioid [3H]dihydromorphine with IC50 values of 7, 20, 7,
and 10 μM, respectively. It was suggested that the binding of the active cannabinoids was
allosteric in nature.
The human voltage-sensitive K+ channel or hERG (47) channel, a voltage-gated potassium
channel expressed in the heart and the nervous system, is responsible for the repolarisation
during the action potential. Blocking of the hERG channel can lead to life-threatening cardiac
arrhythmias and sudden death thus preclinical guidelines require testing drugs under
development for hERG liability. In patch clamp assay an approximately 1:1 mixture of the 9α
and 9β epimers of HHC did not significantly block cloned hERG ion channels (EC50 > 50 μM;)
indicating no cardiac safety issues related to hERG; for the positive control cisaprid EC50 <
0.05 μM (Collins et al., 2022).
The potential of a series of synthetic hexahydrocannabinol analogues (Lee and Xia, 2008) in
the treatment of cancer has also been examined (Thapa et al., 2011). In exploratory
experiments, 9β-HHC (LYR-1) and all its seven analogues inhibited human umbilical vein
endothelial cell (48) proliferation at the 5 μM screening concentration. Of the potent
homologues of 9α-HHC, LYR-7 (Figure 12) and a keto analogue (LYR-8), both lacking CB
receptor affinity, were selected for further investigations. Δ9-THC was not included in these
studies.

TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
64
A recent preprint reported on preliminary results of the anticancer properties of the two HHC
epimers in four pancreatic cancer cell lines (Table 8) (Tesfatsion et al., 2022) (49). Both the
9α and 9β epimers similarly inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells with IC50 values ranging
from 10.3 to 27.2 μM; these values are comparable to the IC50 values of the anticancer
agents olaparib or veliparib. While data for Δ9-THC were not reported, hexahydro–
cannabivarin also inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells with similar micromolar
IC50 values in two of these assays.
Finally, computational approaches have recently been attempted to study the binding
features and selectivity of a series of cannabinoids at CB1 and CB2 receptors (Aviz-Amador
et al., 2021). Molecular docking experiments in silico indicated that HHC, Δ8-THC and Δ9-
THC had similar high calculated binding affinities to the CB2 receptor, and this binding was
facilitated by hydrophobic interactions involving identical amino acid residues of the receptor
protein for the three cannabinoids. For the CB1 receptor, HHC and Δ9-THC displayed similar
high calculated binding affinities, while Δ8-THC bound to this receptor with lower affinity.
In summary, studies conducted since 1940 in animals in vivo and receptor preparations in
vitro indicate that the pharmacology of HHC is similar to that of Δ9-THC and in some assays
the 9β-epimer of the semi-synthetic substance appears to only slightly less potent than its
natural counterpart Δ9-THC. It may also be noted that the observed potency differences
between the two HHC epimers parallel the results of related structural and pharmacological
studies with Δ7-THC epimers showing that the 9β-Δ7-THC (C-11 methyl in quasi-equatorial
orientation) has significant cannabinoid activity while the 9α epimer is weakly active both in
vitro and in vivo (Reggio et al., 1989; Huffman et al., 1995).
While no study examined the (psycho)pharmacology of HHC in humans, recent users’
reports indicate that HHC products have Δ9-THC-like effects reflecting the results of
preclinical investigations.
2.5.3 Psychological and behavioural effects
There appear to be no studies on the psychological and behavioural effects of HHC in
humans.
Apart from the investigations involving dog ataxia, mouse spontaneous locomotion, and rat
and pigeon drug discrimination tests described in Section 2.5.2.1 no other animal
behavioural studies with HHC could be identified.
2.5.4 Safety pharmacology
The toxicology and/or safety pharmacology of HHC have not been investigated until recently.
A recent study (Collins et al., 2022) assessed the cytotoxicity of an approximately 1:1
epimeric mixture of HHC to human lung fibroblasts and plated human hepatocytes (see
Table 8). While potential cytotoxic effects comparable to the positive control ‘Cropromazine’
[sic] were observed in the fibroblast assay at concentrations above 10 μM, essentially no
(
49) Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide and is one of the most difficult tumours to treat
either by surgery or chemotherapy.
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
65
hepatotoxic effects were observed at concentrations below 50 μM (for the terfenadine control
IC50 = 15.8 μM). Furthermore, no mutagenicity was observed in the Ames test with and
without metabolic activation up to 100 μM concentration.
Since the production of HHC does not necessarily comply with ‘Good Manufacturing
Practices’, contaminations either with extraction residues or synthetic by-products could pose
unforeseen risks. Also, traces of heavy metals originating from the catalyst used for the
hydrogenation might also be present. Furthermore, hydrogenation of the acid-treated extract
either before or after decarboxylation may contain derivatives of other cannabinoids that
were originally present in the crude hemp extract. Among these, cannabigerol as well as
tetrahydrocannabivarin and tetrahydrocannabiphorol (THCP) (Section 2.6.1), the respective
3-n-propyl and 3-n-heptyl homologues of THC, have attracted interest recently; the chemical
structure of their hydrogenated derivatives are shown in (Figure 27). There is only scant
scientific literature available on the hydrogenated derivatives of these three cannabinoids
and their pharmacology or toxicology is unknown. The recent findings in hemp of the
bioactive (50) cis-Δ9-THC (Section 2.3.6.1) may also pose additional health risk either due to
their own pharmacological effects or from drug-drug interactions (Nasrin et al., 2021; Lopera
et al., 2022). Since these phytocannabinoids and/or their transformed derivatives could be
present in hemp extracts that are used as feedstocks for the production of HHC complete
analytical characterisation of any hemp-derived product is important from a safety point of
view.

No information is available on any potential drug-drug interaction for HHC.
While suppliers in their marketing advertisements on the Internet often indicate product purity
above 95%, it should also be kept in mind that unregulated products might not contain what
their label indicates even when there is an ‘analytical certificate’ provided. For example, it
has recently been reported that GC-MS analysis of a product sold in the US and submitted to
(
50) The synthetic cis-isomers of THC were at least tenfold less active than Δ9
-THC in animal behavioural studies (Martin et al.,
1981). Recently (–)-cis-Δ9
-THC was found to be a sub-micromolar partial agonist of CB1 and CB2 receptors and an inhibitor at
high micromolar concentrations of endocannabinoid processing enzymes; it also displayed cannabimimetic properties in the
mouse tetrad test (Schafroth et al., 2021).

the laboratory for analysis as an alleged ‘HHC’ sample indicated the presence of Δ8-THC, Δ9-
THC, and Δ6a,10a-THC but not any HHC (Figure 28) (Sams, 2022). In general, such
mislabelling might either be intentional or due to the use of inadequate analytical
methodology or negligence.
FIGURE 28

2.5.5 Pharmacokinetics
In general cannabinoids are highly lipophilic substances and thus accumulate in fatty tissues.
They also highly bound to blood plasma proteins (Widman et al., 1974; Giroud et al., 2001;
Schwilke et al., 2009). Though experimental data are not available, HHC is expected to
share these properties. The measured and the calculated logP values of representative
cannabinoids are shown in Table 1 (Section 2.3.3.1).
The pharmacokinetics of HHC in humans is not known.
There is no information on the pharmacokinetics of HHC in animals in vivo. However, the
metabolism of the 9β-HHC epimer has been studied in microsomal preparations obtained
from five animal species (Harvey, 1991; Harvey and Brown, 1991a; Harvey and Brown,
1991b; see also Harvey and Brown, 1991c). The hydroxylation pattern in vitro appeared to
be broadly similar to that of Δ9-THC even though the Δ9 double bond was missing. Thus, the
main hydroxylation sites were: 1) exocyclic C-11 methyl group, 2) C-8 methylene group, 3) npentyl side chain, and 4) C-4 of the aromatic ring. The nine monohydroxylated metabolites
identified are shown in Figure 29. The species differences were as follows: in the rat, guinea

and hamster the CYP450-catalyzed oxidation preferred the C-8 atom with the mouse
producing the 8α-OH-9β-HHC epimer in abundance while in the hamster microsomal
preparation the 8β-OH-9β-HHC was the dominant epimer. The formation of a unique
aromatic hydroxylation product, that is 4-OH-9β-HHC, was noted in microsomes obtained
from guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbits, albeit in low amounts.

This study appears to have focused on monohydroxylated metabolites and did not report
carboxylic acid species, such as 11-nor-9-COOH-HHC (51). It is not known whether 11-OHHHC would undergo further oxidative biotransformation to afford a water-soluble and,
presumably, non-psychoactive carboxylic acid, which is common for other cannabinoids such
as CBD and Δ9-THC and is a suitable marker for the rapid urinary detection of cannabis
consumption. Though experimental evidence is lacking, it is possible that only the allylic
alcohol moiety present in phytocannabinoids can undergo metabolic oxidation (52) while the
corresponding saturated alcohol is metabolically intact. Since 11-OH-HHC appears to be
nearly equipotent to THC (Skinner et al., 1979; Järbe et al., 1986), its accumulation in the
body would in this case result in longer-lasting (psycho)pharmacological effect compared to
THC.

cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in particular (Watanabe et al., 2002; Sachse-Seeboth

been reported as a metabolite of HHC. Both epimers of 11-nor-9-COOH-HHC have been
prepared for analytical studies (Harvey et al., 1977; Harvey and Paton, 1979; Harvey, 1981),
and the electron-ionisation (EI) mass spectral fragmentations of their deuterated derivatives
are somewhat different at the low ionisation energy (25 eV instead of the common 70 eV) as
shown in Figure 30 (adapted from Harvey, 1992). The main difference between the
fragmentation patterns of the two bis-trimethylsilylated epimers is the abundance of the m/z
372 fragment in the MS spectrum of the 9α epimer. This fragment is produced by the loss of
the CO2TMS group together the benzylic deuterium both in axial configuration. Such an
elimination is not favoured in the 9β epimer in which the carboxy group is equatorial.

GC/MS analysis of the livers of mice treated with Δ11-THC revealed 26 metabolites including
the 9α epimers of 11-OH-HHC and 11-nor-9-COOH-HHC (Harvey et al., 1980). The
metabolism of the parent cannabinoid to these compounds is presumed to involve sequential
oxidation and reduction steps and the partial metabolic scheme is outlined in Figure 31.
Oxidation of the exocyclic double bond would give epoxide isomers (53) which then rearrange
to aldehyde intermediates (none of them are detectable as indicated by square brackets). In
addition, enzymatic reduction of the exocyclic double bond would afford 9β-HHC while
reduction of the transient 9α-aldehyde would lead to the corresponding 9α alcohol.

The tritium-labelled, metabolite-like 11-nor-(7,8-3H2)hexahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid
has also been prepared to investigate adsorption phenomena to glass and plastic tools
commonly used for cannabinoid immunoassay calibration (Blanc et al., 1993).
In summary, the human metabolism of HHC has not yet been studied. The limited studies on
the metabolism of HHC in animal species in vitro and in vivo in of HHC indicate that the initial
oxidative steps are similar to those observed for THC. However, these studies were
restricted to the identification of monohydroxylated metabolites and no other Phase I or
Phase II metabolites were reported. So far, there has been no evidence for the existence of
the carboxylic acid metabolite 11-nor-9-COOH-HHC, which would be the hexahydro
analogue of the principal carboxylic acid metabolite of THC for which several urine
immunoassays have been developed. It is interesting to note, however, that in the liver of
mice treated with isomeric THCs, HHC, and/or 11-nor-9-COOH-HHC were identified (Harvey
et al., 1977; Harvey et al., 1980; see also Brown and Harvey, 1988; Brown and Harvey,

2.5.6 Toxicology
To date, only one study in vitro has examined the toxicological properties of HHC (Collins et
al., 2022) (section 2.5.4).
Since CBD has been found to be a ‘contaminant’ in some HHC products, it is worth
mentioning an ongoing debate on its transformation in the body into psychotropic THC
species.
The report of CBD being converted to Δ9-THC in artificial gastric juice in vitro (Watanabe et
al., 2007) has generated scientific debate on whether the oral consumption of the nonpsychotropic CBD would undergo such a transformation into psychotropic cannabinoids in
the acidic environment of the human gut. While this controversy has not been fully resolved,
it is now generally accepted that conversion of CBD to Δ8-THC and/or Δ9-THC in vivo in
amount sufficient to elicit any pharmacological action is unlikely (Golombek et al., 2020).
In addition, controversial observations regarding e-cigarettes or vaping tools in this regard
should be noted. A recent study aimed to model e-cigarettes using pyrolysis-GC/MS
observed the formation of Δ9-THC and other cannabinoid degradants as pyrolysis products
originating from CBD (Czégény et al., 2021; see also: Daniels et al., 2022). Yet, a realistic
study using e-cigarettes failed to detect in the vapour condensate and no elevated THC
levels were found in the smoke of low-THC cannabis joints (Hindelang et al., 2022). Building
upon the role of acid catalysis for the CBD-to-THC conversion, the use of zeolite catalysts for
the heterogenous cyclisation of CBD into mixtures of Δ8-THC and Δ9-THC have recently
been patented (Adair and Geiling, 2022; Gindelberger, 2022). Ostensibly, devices equipped
with such a conversion system are intended for vaping and their commercialisation may
potentially raise legal issues. However, no handheld hydrogenation device for the conversion
of THCs into HHC has been described.
Contaminants present in HHC products may also pose health risk. Several byproducts
formed during the intramolecular cyclisation of CBD into THCs have been reported (Kiselak
et al., 2020; Marzullo et al., 2020; Meehan-Atrash and Rahman, 2022; Ray et al., 2022;
Takashina et al., 2022; Tsujikawa et al., 2022; Twohig et al., 2022; see also Mechoulam,
1973; Garrett et al., 1978). The occurrences and amounts of the actual byproducts appear to
depend on the reaction condition, such as the acid, solvent and the temperature used for the
transformation of CBD-rich hemp into Δ8-THC. Furthermore, during the subsequent
hydrogenation, the metal catalyst may also induce further transformations. Nevertheless,
there is scarce information on the ingredients other than Δ8-THC or Δ9-THC or any residual
CBD in commercial Δ8-THC products, which are also utilised in HHC manufacture. Figure 32
depicts the chemical structures of representative byproducts arising either from acidcatalysed cyclisation studies of CBD (Mechoulam, 1973; Kiselak et al., 2020; Marzullo et al.,
2020; Meehan-Atrash and Rahman, 2022; Takashina et al., 2022; Tsujikawa et al., 2022),
from analysis of Δ8-THC distillates (Twohig et al., 2022; Radwan et al., 2023), and/or from
detections in 27 commercial vaping products (Meehan-Atrash and Rahman, 2022); The latter
study reported also the presence of traces of heavy metals and ‘silicon’ in some of the
products. A range of additional THC isomers as well as mono- and dihydroxylated
cannabinoids have recently been observed in experiments using either sulphuric acid,

hydrochloric acid or acetic acid as catalyst for the ’isomerization’ of CBD (Kiselak et al.,
2020).
FIGURE 32
Representative byproducts of cannabidiol-based acid-catalysed syntheses of Δ8
-THC.
Additional hydroxylated and chlorinated byproducts have also been reported in model
studies (Kiselak et al., 2020)
No analytical study appears to have been reported in the scientific literature for products sold
as ‘HHC’ (54). Nevertheless, when Δ8-THC preparations are used for the manufacture of
HHC, the presence of the byproducts or their derivatives formed during the catalytic
hydrogenation is to be expected (for representative examples, see Figure 32). Unless the
final product is adequately purified after hydrogenation, the users of contaminated HHC
preparations are unwittingly expose themselves to a range of pharmacologically and
toxicologically uncharacterised chemicals.
While the above contaminations detected in cannabinoid oils or vaping products are the
results of chemical transformations, additional impurities may originate from plant-derived
minor cannabinoids, such as cannabidivarin or tetrahydrocannabihexol, carried over from the
hemp plant during extraction (see, for example Ray et al., 2022). Interestingly, some

HHC is often sold in vaping products. In connection with the E-cigarette or Vaping product
use Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) outbreak in the US in 2019–2020, a study determined by
GC/MS analysis the major ingredients and additives in twelve cannabis vape oil cartridge
samples obtained through the California state surveillance program from September 2018 to
December 2019 (Guo et al., 2021). In addition to naturally occurring cannabinoids, such as
Δ9-THC, cannabicitran, CBN, cannabigerol and cannabivarinol that were present essentially
in all liquids, HHC was found, albeit in low level, in two of the liquid as well as in the vapour
generated from one of them.
2.5.7 Abuse liability and dependence producing potential
The abuse liability and dependence potential of HHC have not been studied. Data from
pharmacological and behavioural experiments with several animal species as well as in vitro
studies indicate that HHC shares the pharmacological mechanism of action of the structurally
related THC suggesting that it may have abuse liability and dependence potential in humans.
2.6 Related substances
2.6.1 Homologues of HHC and other hydrogenated cannabinoid analogues of HHC
The ‘marihuana activity’ of homologous series of ‘tetrahydrocannabinol’ and
hexahydrocannabinol were compared in the dog ataxia assay (Adams et al., 1942; Loewe,
1944; Loewe, 1950). In those early studies the possible variations in the actual purity,
including isomer composition, of the test materials demand prudence in the interpretation of
the published data. Nevertheless, based on the description of the acid-catalysed
transformation of cannabidiol into two isomeric ‘tetrahydrocannabinols’ (Adams et al., 1940c)
it can be inferred that the most potent substance having an optical rotation of –165º is a
preparation enriched in what is now considered to be Δ9-THC (56). However, the ratio of the
epimers of HHC is unknown (for a discussion of the stereochemical outcome of
hydrogenation under various conditions, see Section 2.3.5.1). Figure 33 depicts the activities
of the two homologous series relative to the potent THC isomer. According to this
comparative structure-activity relationship study, the n-hexyl homologues in both series are
more potent than ‘tetrahydrocannabinol’ in this particular bioassay.

substances reflect current terminology.
The genuine biosynthetic cannabinoids in C. sativa are carboxylated species (Hanuš et al.,
2016) that are present in crude, unheated hemp extract. A recent patent has described the
catalytic hydrogenation of such a phytocannabinoid acid mixture (57) to produce the
corresponding hexahydro carboxylic acid species, including hexahydrocannabinolic acid
(HHCA), with anti-tumour properties in mice (Figure 34) (Scialdone, 2017). Though not
discussed in the patent, heat treatment of the hydrogenated mixture gives the respective
decarboxylated cannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabidiol (HCBD or H4CBD) and HHC
(58).

Hydrogenation of phytocannabinoid acids CBDA and THCA in unheated cannabis

Recently, products with a brand name ‘HHC-P’ has been offered on the Internet by several
suppliers and these allegedly contain the hexahydro derivative of tetrahydrocannabiphorol
(THCP). The first identification of hexahydrocannabiphorol59 (HHC-P) in Europe was reported
to the EMCDDA by Slovenia. It was identified in a dark red/brown resinous substance that
was analysed by the Customs Laboratory of Slovenia, seized in November 2022 (EMCDDA,
2023).
THCP has recently been isolated from C. sativa, albeit in trace amounts (Citti et al., 2019;
Linciano et al., 2021). Pharmacological characterisation indicated that in terms of CB1
receptor affinity THCP is about 30-times as potent as THC; its cannabimimetic properties in
three of the tests of the mouse tetrad assay appeared to be comparable to that of THC at
half-dose, that is 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally (Citti et al., 2019). The results obtained in vivo are
similar to those obtained in the early dog ataxia assay (Figure 33) showing comparable
potencies for the C5 and C7 THC homologues.
 A recent analysis by HPLC-MS/MS of the heat-treated (‘decarboxylated’) flower of 14 plants
of different C. sativa varieties found THCP content ranging from 0.0023 to 0.0136 percent by
weight (0.023 to 0.136 mg/g range) with Δ9-THC dominant chemotypes being rich in the
homologue (Bueno and Greenbaum, 2021). It may be noted that distillation (60) of one of the
plant extracts yielded fractions enriched in THCP over three-fold. Such an enriched extract
could possibly be used to produce by hydrogenation the corresponding ‘HHC-P’. Yet, using

the one-step synthetic method outlined in Figure 19 could also be appealing for ‘illicit’
production of HHC-P. Apart from the analytical data provided to support the recent
identification reported by Slovenia, no other analytical data for the marketed ‘HHC-P’
products are available at this time, so their actual chemical composition and the touted high
potency remains to be verified by further investigations.
In a battery of screening tests in mice the 1:1 mixture of the 9α and 9β isomers of the
metabolite-type 11-OH-HHC was nearly equipotent to THC (Table 6) (Skinner et al., 1979).
However, in a rhesus monkey behavioural test, the 1,11-diacetyl derivative of the 11-OH-9βHHC epimer was about one-fourth as potent as THC (Mechoulam et al., 1980). Apart from
species differences and the bioassays used, this suggests that the 11-acetoxy group more
resistant to hydrolysis than the acetylated phenolic moiety (see also Section 2.6.2).
The fully hydrogenated derivative of CBD, also known as H4CBD, was first prepared in 1940
by hydrogenation of cannabidiol in acetic acid using platinum oxide catalyst (Jacob and
Todd, 1940). Analytical characterisations of the 1α and 1β epimers of H4CBD by NMR,
HPLC and GC-MS has recently been published (Collins et al., 2023). H4CBD has been
found to have moderate receptor affinity with a Ki = 143 nM (in contrast, CBD has
insignificant affinity to cannabinoid receptors), and to have anti-inflammatory properties in
vitro by suppressing the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and nitric acid, and by
suppressing tumour necrosis factor (Ben-Shabat et al., 2006).
2.6.2 Acetate esters of HHC, and representative tetrahydrocannabinol isomers
2.6.2.1 Chemistry
Cannabinoids acylated at the phenolic group do not occur naturally, they are synthetic
derivatives of plant-derived compounds. Acetylation, or acylation in general, of the phenolic
groups of tetrahydrocannabinols results in a slight increase in their lipophilicity relative to the
parent compound, thereby facilitating penetration into the central nervous system. At the
same time, the phenolic groups are, at least temporarily, protected from metabolic
inactivation by conjugation or oxidation albeit relevant experimental evidence for the
cannabinoids is lacking (61). Spontaneous or enzymatic hydrolysis by carboxylesterases of
the ester liberates the free bioactive phenol (see Watanabe et al., 2005). Such esters are
typically inactive in vitro, but serve as prodrugs for the bioactive phenolic species (62). Figure
35 shows the molecular structure, molecular formula, and molecular mass of representative
cannabinoid acetate derivatives discussed in this section.
The acetate esters of Δ8-THC and Δ9-THC have been known for decades (63) (Adams et al.,
1940a; Adams et al., 1945; Edery et al., 1972; Inayama et al., 1974; Petrzilka, 1975). In fact,
a popular booklet on ’cannabis alchemy’ provides a detailed description of the synthesis of
‘THC acetate’ (Hoye, 1973). The acid-catalysed isomerization of Δ9-THC acetate (Δ9-THC-O)
(
61) A notable exception is levanonatradol and its desacetyl derivative (Johnson and Melvin, 1986; Howlett et al., 1988).
(

into Δ8-THC acetate (Δ8-THC-O) has also been demonstrated (Gaoni and Mechoulam,
1966b; Gaoni and Mechoulam, 1968).
The first report on illicit acetylation of a cannabis extract appeared in 1988 and concerns an
earlier case encountered in the Jacksonville, Florida area, US, in 1978 (Cooper, 1988). An
excess of acetic acid anhydride was used for the acetylation of the extract; no forensic
analysis results were given in this publication. Later, the New Zealand Police seized a dark
brown/yellow oil which, after analysis by TLC and GC-MS and relying on a reference sample
prepared in the laboratory, contained Δ9-THC acetate as the major product along with
cannabinol acetate, a minor component (Valentine, 1996). However, the acetylated
derivative of HHC appears to have been reported only once (Wollner et al., 1942). After
decades of hiatus, acetylated HHC or HHC acetate, colloquially known as ‘HHC-O’, emerged
on the drug market possibly in late 2021.

Synthesis
HHC-O can readily be synthesised either from the acetates of Δ8-THC or Δ9-THC, or their
mixtures by catalytic hydrogenation as described (Wollner et al., 1940). It was characterised
as viscous oil having an optical rotation of [α]
21 –119º (Wollner et al., 1942). HHC-O can also
be conveniently prepared by acylation with acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride similar to the
method used for the preparation of THC acetates (Figure 36). Esters of HHC-O or any other
phenolic cannabinoid acylated by a desired carboxylic acid can also be readily prepared
using similar procedures.

Recently, HPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS methods have been developed for the identification and
quantitation of major phytocannabinoids as well as Δ8-THC-O, Δ9-THC-O and CBD-diacetate for the analysis of a commercial gummy edible product labelled to contain 10 mg
‘THC-O’ per 100 mg per gummy. Analyses revealed that the amount of cannabinoids in one
piece of gummy were 0.18 mg Δ8-THC, 0.058 mg Δ9-THC, 0.30 mg Δ8-THC-O, 0.45 mg Δ9-
THC-O and 0.19 CBD-di-acetate (Holt et al., 2022). It was also noted that the concentrations
of the cannabinoids were approximately 30 times larger in the outer section of the gummies
than in the inner portions of the gummy. Additional ingredients identified by GC-MS in the
gummy were ‘2-furanmethanol’, L-lactic acid, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, palmitic acid and
(10E,12Z)-linoleic acid. No terpenes were found indicating that the products had been made
using CBD isolate rather than full hemp extract.

TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
79
The cannabinoid-like pharmacology of the acetates of Δ8-THC and Δ9-THC (Δ8-THCO and
Δ9-THC-O, respectively) has been studied both in vitro and in vivo. Only the most relevant
publications are discussed next.
Early studies assessed the potency of derivatives ‘tetrahydrocannabinol’ preparations in the
dog ataxia test and reported that the acetate of ‘tetrahydrocannabinol’ had about twice the
potency of the parent phenolic ‘tetrahydrocannabinol’ (Wollner et al., 1942; Adams et al.,
1945) (71) but the material used in these studies might have contained predominantly the
semi-synthetic Δ6a,10a-THC isomer, which is less potent than the natural Δ9 isomer (see Table
II in Mechoulam and Edery, 1973).
In rhesus monkey behavioural assay, both isomeric THC acetate prodrugs at 1 mg/kg
intravenous dose elicited behavioural changes to a similar degree as those caused by the
phenolic parents, that is Δ8-THC or Δ9-THC at the lower 0.5–0.9 mg/kg or 0.1–0.25 mg/kg
doses, respectively (Edery et al., 1971; Edery et al., 1972). Figure 37, in which the graph is
based on the numerical scores in the original publications, indicates that Δ8-THC (72) is about
half as potent as Δ9-THC (73), but this potency difference between the acetate derivatives
disappears in this assay. Yet both esters are severalfold less active than their parent phenols
upon intravenous administration. It was noted that the activity of the acetates was slightly
delayed (10–15 minutes versus 15–30 minutes) and might be prolonged (4–4.5 hours versus
5–6 hours) suggesting that the acetates act as prodrugs which need to undergo hydrolysis to
release the active phenolic species.
(
71) In spite of uncertainties regarding the actual identity of the test materials (Mechoulam and Edery, 1973), the results of these
early studies have often been misleadingly quoted on the Internet.
(
72) For a comprehensive review on the pharmacology of Δ8
-THC, see Tagen and Klumpers, 2022; on the dependence potential
of Δ8
-THC in the mouse, see Vanegas et al., 2022.
(
73) In a human trial, the potency of Δ8
-THC was found to be two-thirds that of Δ9
-THC either upon oral or intravenous
administration (Hollister and Gillespie, 1973).

(Edery et al., 1971; Edery et al., 1972)
Finally, it should be mentioned that the known cannabidiol diacetate (Edery et al., 1972), as
‘CBD-O’, as well as cannabigerol diacetate, as ‘CBG-O’ (74), have recently been offered by
online vendors. While the anticonvulsant properties of CBD diacetate have been
demonstrated (Consroe et al., 1981), it is likely that – similar to the parent cannabidiol – it is
devoid of any cannabimimetic activity.
2.6.3. Esters of related tetrahydrocannabinoids
2.6.3.1 Chemistry and pharmacology
As with the acetate esters of Δ8-THC and Δ9-THC, other acyl derivatives of cannabinoid
phenols are expected to be prodrugs of the parent cannabinoid. The kinetics of the release of
the parent phenol from its O-acyl derivative might be manipulated by the nature of the
acylating group, albeit relevant information in the cannabinoid series is limited to a few
studies (75).
The acetates of both Δ8-THC and Δ9-THC have been shown to metabolise in vitro by liver
microsomes of several animals into the parent cannabinoid and the biotransformation is
catalysed by the serine hydrolase carboxylesterases (Watanabe et al., 2005). Such
hydrolysis is plausible for HHC-O as well.
(
74) Note that ‘CBGO’ is also an acronym for the shorter CBG homologue cannabigerorcin.
(
75) Interestingly, the 4-hydroxybutanoate derivatives of THC-type cannabinoids (‘mutual prodrugs’) have not been described in
the literature in spite of their likely facile synthesis from GBL (gamma-butyrolactone) and a phenolic cannabinoid.
TECHNICAL REPORT I Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and related substances
81
The pharmacological profile of the hemisuccinate ester of Δ9-THC (R = C(O)CH2CH2COOH
in Figure 38) upon intravenous injection in mice was similar to that of the parent cannabinoid
but it was less potent (Martin et al., 1987). It depressed spontaneous activity (SA), caused
hypothermia (HT) and produced antinociception as indicated in the tail-flick (TF) assay but
was 0.15, 0.30 and 0.34, respectively, as potent as Δ9-THC, for which the ED50 values were
2.3 and 1,9 mg/kg for SA and TF, respectively, and caused a 1.6 ºC drop at 3 mg/kg.
Conceivably, the cannabimimetic activity is due to in vivo hydrolysis of the ester prodrug to
Δ9-THC.
Suppository formulation of several ester derivatives, including the hemisuccinate, the
methoxyacetyl derivative and a carbamate derivative of Δ9-THC were prepared and tested in
monkeys and dogs (Figure 38) (ElSohly et al., 1991).
Among several water-soluble prodrugs of Δ9-THC esterified with piperazine- or morpholinecontaining acyl moieties, the 4-morpholinobutyric acid ester (SP-111) (Figure 38) had
cannabimimetic properties similar to the parent cannabinoid (Zitko et al., 1972; Järbe and
McMillan, 1980).
Evaluation of the cannabimimetic activity of MB-Δ8-THC (Figure 38) in the mouse tetrad test
indicated that this analogue was approximately equipotent to the phenolic Δ8- and Δ9-THC in
reducing locomotor activity, but of intermediate potency in producing hypothermia relative to
the phenolic cannabinoids; this water-soluble derivative was less potent than the phenolic
cannabinoids as an antinociceptive drug in the mouse tail-flick assay (Compton and Martin,
1990).
The water-soluble phosphate ester prodrug of Δ8-THC showed cannabimimetic activities with
favourable toxicological properties in mice (Figure 38) (Yoshimura et al., 1978).
A transdermal formulation of the D-(–)-glyceric acid ester prodrug of Δ9-THC, ZYN001
(Figure 38), was developed as potential treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders (Banks et al.,
2015) but after phase 1 clinical trials its development was discontinued (76).

2.6.3.2 Analysis
Mass spectrometry analysis of the acetyl derivatives of Δ8-THC and Δ9-THC as well as CBN
has been reported (Inayama et al., 1976).
Radioimmunoassays of Δ8-THC acetate using either the Roche Abuscreen® or the Abbott
TDx® cannabinoid test kits did not show appreciable cross-reactivity (Jones et al., 1984;
Jones et al., 1985; ElSohly et al., 1990).
2.6.3.3 Toxicology
HHC-O products are often sold in cartridges and as refill liquids intended for vaping. In 2019
US health officials reported an outbreak of e-cigarette vaping associated acute lung injury
(EVALI) associated with vaping products containing vitamin E acetate (VEA) (77) diluent
added to the active ingredients, such as nicotine, THC or synthetic cannabinoids (US CDC,
2020). By February 2020, the epidemic resulted in 2,807 hospitalisation and 68 deaths
associated with EVALI in the US (Rebuli et al., 2023).
The aetiology of the serious lung injury is yet to be clarified. It has been suggested that
ketene (78) generated upon heating VEA is the causative agents of EVALI although other
(
77) Commercial vitamin E acetate is a mixture of stereoisomeric tocopheryl acetates.

toxic or sensitising components (79) of the hitherto poorly characterised mixture of chemicals
in the vapour could also be involved in EVALI (Narimani and da Silva, 2020; Wu and O’Shea,
2020; Feldman et al., 2021; Xantus et al., 2021; Marrocco et al., 2022).
It has been proposed that not only VEA but cannabinoid acetates may also release ketene
when heated (Meehan-Atrash and Rahman, 2021; Benowitz et al., 2023). In fact, ketene
formation has recently been noted in model experiments with chemically pure acetates CBNO, Δ8-THC-O and the diacetate of CBD (Munger et al., 2022) using the method devised for
the vapour analysis of heated VEA (Wu and O’Shea, 2020). For example, the gaseous
ketene released from a heated dab of Δ8-THC acetate was trapped with benzylamine to yield
N-benzylacetamide (Figure 39), which was readily characterised by proton NMR and GCMS. It was estimated that this amount would correspond to 0.022 mg ketene per puff, which
is below the 0.042 mg NISH IDHL (80) threshold value calculated from the 5.0 ppm
established for occupational exposure to the gas (81). Similar experiments with commercial
vape pen cartridges also confirmed ketene formation (Munger et al., 2022; Benowitz et al.,
2023). Thus, formation of ketene is to be expected when smoking or vaping other acetylated
phenolic cannabinoids, including HHC-O.
(
79) In addition to ketene, reactive oxygen species and quinonemethides, as well as other pyrolytic degradation products not
originally present in the e-liquid but formed at high temperature in the vaping device may act in a synergistic manner to cause
lung damage when inhaled.
(
80) For the IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) limit for ketene, see https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0367.html.
Accessed on 20 December 2022.
(
81) Based upon model experiments, at vaping temperature above 700 ºC, in-lung ketene concentration as high as 30 ppm has
been predicted (Narimani and da Silva, 2020).

Ketene formation from Δ8-THC acetate and subsequent trapping with benzylamine

Ketene may also be similarly formed from heated heroin, which also contains a labile
acetylated phenol moiety, and such a degradation can be expected when inhaling the
vapours of the heated drug (‘chasing the dragon’). However, this has not been
experimentally demonstrated (Klous et al., 2006; for a review on the pyrolysis of
psychoactive substances, see Bell and Nida, 2015).
